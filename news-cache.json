      "content": "# The latest AI news we announced in September\n\nOct 08, 2025\n\nHere’s a recap of some of our biggest AI updates from September, including an AI upgrade for Chrome, a new visual search option in AI Mode and the next step in bringing helpful robots into the physical world.\n\nFor more than 20 years, we’ve invested in machine learning and AI research, tools and infrastructure to build products that make everyday life better for more people. Teams across Google are working on ways to unlock AI’s benefits in fields as wide-ranging as healthcare, crisis response and education. To keep you posted on our progress, we're doing a regular roundup of Google's most recent AI news.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of our AI announcements from September.\n\nForget pumpkin spice; the real news from September was the massive stack of AI updates. AI delivered major updates across our most popular core services like Chrome, Search and Android, making them significantly smarter. And the Gemini app became a powerhouse with its latest Gemini Drop, featuring the viral Nano Banana, Gemini Live, custom and shareable Gems, and the no-code app-building tool, Canvas. Meanwhile, even as we integrate AI across our digital products, Google DeepMind is busy working to bring helpful robots into the physical world.\n\nWith AI our overarching goal remains the same: to make AI as useful as possible, whether through the fun, visible features that help you with everyday tasks or in the essential, behind-the-scenes magic boosting your cybersecurity and learning.\n\nWe added major new AI features to Chrome. Gemini in Chrome now acts as an AI browsing assistant, letting you answer questions and find information across all of your open tabs. We also introduced AI Mode in the omnibox for asking complex, multi-part questions, alongside future agentic capabilities that will automate multi-step tasks like ordering groceries. Plus, AI is now keeping you safer by proactively blocking new types of scams and enhancing security and privacy features. To take a deeper look at the update, we shared how AI was built into the new, shinier Chrome.\n\nWe shared five tips for Search Live, a new way to get help in real-time. By integrating an interactive voice conversation in AI Mode with the ability to share your phone’s camera feed, we’ve created a new way to get multimodal help in real-time. Search can now literally see what your camera sees and respond instantly, providing hands-free help with tasks like travel exploration, complex troubleshooting and bringing school projects to life.\n\nWe expanded AI Mode to new languages. This update brings our most powerful AI search experience, powered by a custom version of Gemini, to new languages globally: Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish. The expansion focuses on a nuanced understanding of local information so users can ask complex questions and explore the web more deeply in their preferred language.\n\nWe shared 10 ways you can use Nano Banana in the Gemini app. Since launching in August, Google DeepMind’s image generation and editing model, fondly known as Nano Banana, has quickly grown in popularity in the Gemini app. So we created 10 examples to show how capable and fun the model is, whether you’re looking for more straightforward tasks like swapping outfits in a photo, or interested in complex, imaginative image generation, like showing your adult self having a tea party with a younger you.\n\nWe made collaboration easier in the Gemini app with the ability to share custom Gems. Gems allow you to tailor Gemini for specific needs, and now you can share the ones you create with friends, family or coworkers. The sharing process is similar to Google Drive, giving you control over who can view or edit your personalized AI tools like detailed vacation guides or even custom meal planners.\n\nWe launched new Android features to help you polish and share what you write. The latest features in Android include new AI writing tools in Gboard to revise your tone and automatically fix spelling and grammar right on your device. We also announced the ability to let two people listen to the same audio simultaneously, introduced a way to create private QR code audio broadcasts and redesigned Quick Share for instant file transfer previews and live progress updates.\n\nWe've introduced the next step in bringing helpful robots into the physical world. Google DeepMind is leveling up robotics with Gemini Robotics 1.5 and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, kicking off the era of physical agents. These models let robots see, plan, think and use tools to tackle complicated, multi-step tasks far better than before, and allow for learnings to transfer between different types of robots. Think of Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 as the smart brain, handling the big-picture reasoning (and even Googling stuff!) while Gemini Robotics 1.5 is the mover, turning visual information and instructions into motor commands for a robot to perform a task.\n\nWe introduced new features into NotebookLM to help with learning. Our latest updates turn NotebookLM into your ultimate personal AI study partner, with a focus on active learning. You can instantly create flashcards and quizzes grounded in your own notes, generate upgraded reports with suggested formats like a blog post or study guide, and try the Learning Guide option for personalized, step-by-step tutoring. Plus, you can now hear your sources in new ways with Audio Overviews that offer perspectives like a Critique or a Debate.\n\nWe launched new resources to promote AI literacy for parents, students and educators. These resources include a new podcast for parents called \"Raising kids in the age of AI,\" expanded student programs like the Be Internet Awesome AI Literacy curriculum and the AI Quests game-based experience. This work includes substantial support for teachers, with over 650,000 educators trained so far and $40 million in grants dedicated to scaling AI literacy programs.\n\nWe introduced Guided Learning, a new, interactive study partner in the Gemini app. Powered by LearnLM, Guided Learning fine tunes our AI models for education, allowing people to navigate any topic, step-by-step, to ask questions and promote understanding. With helpful videos and images, the result is a personalized tutor that can break down complex code, create study plans from your uploaded material, and guide you to homework solutions without doing the work for you.\n\nSundar Pichai spoke at the White House AI Education Taskforce. Sundar highlighted Google’s major push to support AI education across the U.S., including offering Gemini for Education to every high school in America. It builds on Google’s broader $1 billion commitment to support AI education in the U.S., including giving all students and teachers access to our best AI tools, putting $150 million towards grants for AI education and digital wellbeing, and expanding our AI for Education Accelerator from 100 to 200 colleges and universities.\n\nWe sent our AI to the International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals. Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieved a major AI milestone by achieving gold-medal level performance at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals. This breakthrough performance in abstract problem-solving builds on our previous gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad, proving Gemini's world-class coding and reasoning capabilities.\n\n#### Gemini Enterprise: The new front door for Google AI in your workplace\n\n#### 4 ways Gemini Enterprise makes work easier for everyone\n\n#### Teaming up with LA28, Team USA and NBCUniversal for the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n#### Google is powering Belgium's digital future with a two-year €5 billion investment in AI infrastructure.\n\n#### AI Mode is now available in more languages and locations around the world.\n\n#### Google AI Plus is coming to 36 more countries.",

These are the lessons we could learn. Particle6 Productions Hollywood’s first AI ‘actor’ has officially launched her career. Is this the future of film, or is it a gimmick? As AI becomes more integrated, it will continue to influence organizational tone, pace, communication style and decision-making norms. (Getty Images/Unsplash+) Without deliberate strategies, over-reliance on AI could erode self-trust, creativity and ethical judgment and leave organizations more fragile, not more resilient. The first attempt to lay submarine telegraph cable between Britain and France. Universal History Archive/Getty The telegraph was hailed for its revolutionary ability to span distance. Now AI is being hailed as a great leap forward. But both came with environmental costs. Sean Gladwell/Getty Images While we’re at the peak of AI hype, some people are concerned it will wipe out humanity. Students must learn not just how to use AI, but how to question it. Oscar Omondi via Unsplash Employers and societies demand graduates who can evaluate information and make sound judgments. Teachers need to be scientists themselves, experimenting and measuring the impact of powerful AI products on education.

      "content": "# AI is a strategic tool to improve scientific research\n\n© Gorodenkoff, stock.adobe.com\n\nThe Commission publishes today “[A European Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in Science Paving the way for the Resource for AI Science in Europe (RAISE)](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/c1afd7d0-ff65-4f84-be48-b0e0949596c5_en)” to accelerate the adoption of AI by European scientists in all disciplines.\n\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) report“[Role of Artificial Intelligence in Scientific Research - A Science for Policy, European Perspective](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC143482)” accompanies the Strategy, providing a detailed analysis on the use of AI in the scientific process and the landscape of AI in science.This report helps policymakers develop informed policies to unlock AI’s full potential for EU research and paves the way for informed investment decisions.\n\nThe JRC will lead the future **AI Evaluation Hub**, announced in the Strategy, to monitor and evaluate AI models and systems in strategic scientific fields.\n\n## The EU has the biggest share of AI research players\n\nThe JRC studied the global distribution of AI players, including research institutes, government bodies and firms publishing scientific articles, filing for priority patents or having their core business in AI activities.\n\nUntil 2024, two in five global AI players had at least one research and innovation (R&I) activity, (i.e. had filed for a patent on AI or published a scientific article on the topic). The JRC finds that among the AI players with research activities, the EU has the biggest share of AI research players (13%, US 4%, China 1%).\n\n## Accelerating the adoption of AI tools in research\n\nTo accelerate the uptake of AI in science, the JRC stresses the need for shared infrastructures and open science to ensure reproducibility, wider access, and trustworthiness.\n\nWhile AI models are becoming more powerful and versatile, they also require significant resources for training and deployment. This makes investment in High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI Factories (ecosystems that foster innovation and collaboration) and open scientific data repositories essential to secure EU's position as a leader in AI research.\n\nA larger use of AI in science would generate new requirements for specialised expertise among researchers. The JRC assessment on skills shows the need for “hybrid” (multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary) teams that combine expertise in engineering, computer sciences and AI with specific domain expertise. Policies should therefore focus on attracting, developing and retaining this interdisciplinary talent to ensure that human expertise remains central to the research process.\n\n## AI is reshaping scientific research\n\nResearchers use AI to enhance search and discovery in science, leveraging its context-aware and semantic search capabilities to generate answers based on search results.\n\nThe JRC report finds that scientists employ AI tools in varied fields, tasks and disciplines, from engineering to life sciences and humanities to drive real, applicable innovations. This includes using AI tools to analyse proteins more efficiently in life-science research, an AI application proven particularly successful in medicine like more effective drug discovery.\n\n## Background\n\nDrawing on deep dives into AI technology for protein structure prediction, material discovery and computational humanities, JRC report showcases how AI is accelerating innovation and strengthening EU research.\n\nOpportunities are emerging across the full scientific process, from data analysis to the generation of novel research hypotheses. By assessing their potential and impact, the report gathers invaluable insights to guide investments in crucial areas such as high-performance computing and open-science infrastructure. This research can thereby boost EU competitiveness at global leve\n\nThe EU [Competitiveness compass](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/competitiveness-compass_en), published in January 2025, and the [Clean Industrial Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en), published in February 2025, emphasise the importance of circular economy in creating a more sustainable, resilient and competitive European industrial sector, that in turn supports the EU's climate goals, while promoting more efficient technologies and job creation.\n\n## Related videos\n\nValentin Comte and his colleagues in the Digital Health team at the Joint Research Centre are exploring the latest scientific breakthroughs in medical imaging\n\nSee also: [AI in Science – Disaster Risk Management](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/media/video/I-278437).\n\n## Related link\n\n[Press release - Commission launches two strategies to speed up AI uptake in European industry and science](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2299)\n\n## Details\n\nPublication date8 October 2025AuthorJoint Research Centre\n\nJRC portfolios 2025-27\n\n- [AI and data](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/scientific-portfolios/ai-and-data_en)\n\n## More news on a similar topic\n\n- News announcement - 25 September 2025\n\n[Rising trend of new childhood cancer cases in EU over time](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/rising-trend-new-childhood-cancer-cases-eu-over-time-2025-09-25_en)\n\n- 3 min read\n\n- General publications - 11 July 2025\n\n[Wearable data: can they be shared for a public interest, such as healthcare?](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/wearable-data-can-they-be-shared-public-interest-such-healthcare-2025-07-11_en)\n\n- 3 min read\n\n- General publications - 1 July 2025\n\n[AI in medical imaging: where do we stand and what comes next?](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/ai-medical-imaging-where-do-we-stand-and-what-comes-next-2025-07-01_en)\n\n- 3 min read\n\n- News announcement - 13 June 2025\n\n[How is generative AI impacting our economy, society and policy?](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/how-generative-ai-impacting-our-economy-society-and-policy-2025-06-13_en)\n\n- 4 min read",

      "content": "## 2. Current state and applications of AI technology\n\n### 2.1. Application of AI technology in scientific research and its latest developments\nRecent years have witnessed significant developments in AI, especially in deep learning, machine learning, and NLP. These advances have not only led to innovative algorithms but also enhanced computing power and data processing efficiency. AI role in scientific research spans from theoretical studies to experimental methodologies (Fig. [F1]).\n\nInnovations in AI algorithms, cutting-edge research show advancements in AI models, especially in neural networks with complex architectures, offering improved data handling and predictive accuracy for unstructured data like images and texts.[6-9]\nGenomic research breakthroughs, AI now plays a pivotal role in genomic research, going beyond data extraction to predicting gene functions and interactions. This evolution aids in understanding complex genetic diseases and tailoring medical treatments, as documented in recent biomedical literature.[10-13] AI Impact on environmental science, machine learning is increasingly employed in environmental science, utilizing satellite imagery and sensor data to model climate change scenarios and monitor ecological changes with unprecedented precision.[14-17] Materials science advancements, in materials science, AI accelerates the discovery of new materials with desired properties, reducing the reliance on extensive laboratory experimentation, as noted in contemporary research papers.[18-20] Robotics integration, the fusion of AI with robotics is revolutionizing experimental research. AI-driven robots can autonomously conduct experiments, dynamically adjusting parameters based on real-time data, thereby enhancing experimental efficiency and reproducibility.[21-24] Applications in social sciences, AI application extends to the social sciences, analyzing large-scale data to decipher patterns in human behavior. This informs public policy and economic strategies, as explored in recent social science research.[25] Ethical considerations and governance, contemporary literature increasingly highlights ethical implications and the need for governance frameworks in AI applications, especially to safeguard data privacy and ensure responsible AI usage in sensitive fields like healthcare.[26-29]\nThese advancements underscore AI transformative role across scientific disciplines, presenting both immense potential and new challenges in research methodology and ethics.\n\n### 2.2. The role of AI in data analysis, literature generation, and experimental design\nIn the realm of data analysis, AI technologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms, excel in processing big data, identifying data patterns, and conducting predictive analysis. For instance, by utilizing AI to analyze environmental data, researchers can predict climate change trends more accurately. This efficient data processing capability makes AI an indispensable tool in scientific research.[30]\nThe advancement of NLP technologies has also made AI pivotal in literature generation. AI tools, such as automatic summary generators and literature management software, assist researchers in efficiently organizing and summarizing vast amounts of scientific literature. This reduces the workload of literature reviews to some extent, allowing researchers to focus more on innovative studies.[31]\nIn experimental design, the application of AI technology significantly enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of experiments. Machine learning algorithms, for example, are used to design and optimize experimental procedures and predict outcomes. In some cases, AI can even automate experimental operations and data collection. This not only accelerates the experimental process but also improves the reliability of the results.[32]\nThese applications demonstrate that AI technology not only plays a supportive role in scientific work but has also become a key driver in advancing science. However, with the widespread application of AI technology, concerns have arisen regarding its potential to contribute to academic misconduct in research. This requires a joint effort from the scientific community and regulatory bodies to ensure the integrity and quality of research.[32]\n<FG id='F1'>\n**Figure 1**: Figure 1.\n<F href='medi-103-e38811-g001.jpg'>\nA visual concept map to outline the application of AI technology in the research lifecycle.

A new study finds that communicating the scientific consensus about climate change can clear up misperceptions and strengthen beliefs about the existence and the causes of climate change. The team surveyed over 10,000 people from 27 countries on 6 continents. Share: Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIN Email\n\nFULL STORY Climate scientists have long agreed that humans are largely responsible for climate change. A new study, co-led by Bojana Ve?kalov from the University of Amsterdam and Sandra Geiger from the University of Vienna, finds that communicating the scientific consensus about climate change can clear up misperceptions and strengthen beliefs about the existence and the causes of climate change. The team surveyed over 10,000 people from 27 countries on 6 continents. The study has just been published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. Scientific consensus identifying humans as primarily responsible for climate change is not new and was already forming in the 1980s. Today, 97% to 99.9% of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and that human activity is the primary cause. Over the past decade, researchers have begun to study the effects of communicating this overwhelming consensus -- with promising results. So far, however, such studies have primarily been conducted in the United States. \"As is the case with many findings in behavioral science, we know little about the effects of communicating this consensus beyond the United States. Our study now takes an extensive and detailed look at these effects,\" says environmental psychologist Sandra Geiger from the University of Vienna. The international research team of 46 collaborators showed different scientific consensus messages to more than 10,500 people and subsequently asked them about their opinions on climate change. \"We observed that previous findings from the United States hold true in other parts of the world as well,\" explains co-lead author Bojana Većkalov from the University of Amsterdam. Across all 27 countries, people responded similarly to the scientific consensus on the existence and causes of climate change. Co-lead author Geiger further explains: \"Prior to reading about the consensus among climate scientists, people estimated this consensus to be much lower than it really is. In response to reading about it, they adjusted their own perceptions, believed more in climate change, and worried more about it -- but they did not support public action on climate change more.\" 88% of climate scientists additionally agree that climate change constitutes a crisis. How do people react when they learn about this additional crisis consensus? Interestingly, this added piece of information did not have any effects. Co-lead author Većkalovexplains: \"We believe that the gap between the actual and perceived consensus could have played a role. When it came to consensus on the existence and causes of climate change, respondents thought the scientific consensus was lower than it actually was, adjusted their estimate, and revised their beliefs. In the case of the crisis consensus, the respondents' estimate was substantially closer to the actual consensus, and this gap was likely not big enough to alter beliefs about climate change.\" These new findings show that it is important to continue emphasizing the consensus among climate scientists -- be it in the media or in our everyday lives when we have conversations about climate change and its impacts. \"Especially in the face of increasing politicization of science and misinformation about climate change, cultivating universal awareness of the scientific consensus will help protect public understanding of the issue,\" adds senior author Sander van der Linden from the University of Cambridge. \"Beyond climate change communication, these findings also underscore the importance of testing previous findings in behavioral science globally. Such endeavors are only possible if we bring together researchers worldwide,\" summarizes study co-lead Sandra Geiger.\n\n/col-md-8\n\n- [RELATED TOPICS](#) Earth & Climate Environmental Awareness Environmental Policy Geography Earth Science Science & Society Popular Culture Political Science World Development\n\n- [RELATED TERMS](#) Scientific misconduct Global warming controversy Attribution of recent climate change Antarctica IPCC Report on Climate Change - 2007 United Nations Development Programme Climate change mitigation Climate engineering\n\n/col-xs-6\n\n/row\n\n/col-md-4\n\n/row\n\n/story_source\n\n/related_multimedia\n\n**Journal Reference**:\n\n1.

      "content": "In 1991, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) embarked upon the extensive and comprehensive Earth Science Enterprise, a program to help us better understand what is happening on the Earth’s surface. The centerpiece of the Earth Science Enterprise is known as The Earth Observing System (EOS). The EOS website, located at **[http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/]()**, is designed to keep scientists, educators, and the news media informed about the system and its activities.\n\nEOS is composed of a series of satellites conducting long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. The first EOS satellite, Terra, was launched into orbit in December 1999. NASA hopes the data gathered by the system, the first to provide integrated measurements of processes occurring on Earth, can be used to help better predict climate change, oversee conservation efforts, and improve forecasting to help farmers, fishers, and other weather-dependent tradespeople.\n\nThe For Scientists section of the website provides links to overviews of the field experiments that EOS conducts, and contains information on what sorts of measurements EOS takes and what types of instruments are used. Also within this section are links to brochures, reference books, data product catalogs, a bibliography of EOS-related publications, and a calendar of workshops and conference seminars conducted by EOS personnel.\n\nTeachers looking for EOS-related resources can visit the For Educators section. The EOS Education Project, with a link located under the Educational Links subhead, has been developed for teachers and students at all levels to teach about topics including geographic information systems and remote sensing. The project offers outreach programs for teachers and Internet-based classes. This section also features a directory of other EOS-related teaching materials, including brochures, fact sheets, posters, lithographs, and lesson plans that can be downloaded or ordered for free. Also available are online tools for calculating when a satellite will pass overhead and tracking various satellites’ current location in the sky. Links to other websites include the main NASA Earth Science Enterprise educational website and the homepages of related agencies such as the National Science Foundation.\n\nNews writers have their own section on the website. Available under For News Media is the Earth Observatory Newsroom, which contains press releases on the latest EOS research, NASA news announcements, and a list of newly published research. This section also features the EOS Global Change Media Directory 2001. This resource lists 343 scientists working in fields such as ozone chemistry, global warming, and ecosystems who have expressed interest in working with the media. Science writers’ guides to individual spacecraft provide extensive background material and contact information.\n\nThe site’s Data Services section provides links to the different types of data that the EOS and its partners provide. This section links to NASA’s Global Change Master Directory website, which provides extensive data sets on 13 topics, including agriculture, human dimensions, oceans, and sun-Earth interactions. Subscribers can add to the data sets and participate in an online discussion list.\n",

The publication writes that it \"covers clean energy, carbon energy, nuclear energy and environmental science—plus the territory in between where law, policy and public opinion are shaped.\"\n\nEstablished in 2007, the Brooklyn, New York-based website covers environmental issues. In 2013 three of its staff members won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting on the Kalamazoo River oil spill in Michigan.\n\nHistory\n\nThe website was co-founded in 2007 by publisher David Sassoon and executive editor Stacy Feldman. Originally called SolveClimate News, it adopted its current name \"to counter the perception that it was an environmental advocacy organization.\" As a non-profit journalism outlet, Inside Climate Newss model is similar to that of ProPublica and the Center for Investigative Reporting, which have similarly gained recognition. Like the other two organizations, Inside Climate News publishes its content for free on the Web, collaborates with for-profit news organizations that republish some of the nonprofit's work with credit, and aims \"to tackle topics that bigger, better-known news organizations are not equipped or inclined to do.\"\n\nA 2015 article by Jillian Melchior in National Review said there are questions about Inside Climate News's possible conflict of interest and bias.\n\nAs of February 2018, Inside Climate News had a staff of 18, including 7 full-time reporters.\n\nAwards \nThree Inside Climate News reporters—Elizabeth McGowan, Lisa Song, and David Hasemyer—won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for their series of \"rigorous reports\" on the Kalamazoo River oil spill in Michigan, in which an Enbridge oil pipeline spill led to the costliest onshore oil spill in American history.  The Pulitzer citation praised the reporters for exporting the aftermath of the 2010-2012 oil spill and \"flawed regulation of the nation's oil pipelines, focusing on potential ecological dangers posed by diluted bitumen (or 'dilbit'), a controversial form of oil.\"\n\nIn April 2016, Inside Climate News was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, for the 2015 Exxon: The Road Not Taken series.  Inside Climate News was awarded a 2015 Sigma Delta Chi Award for excellence in journalism by the Society of Professional Journalists for the informational graphics in the Exxon: The Road Not Taken series, which \"provide a visual timeline of Exxon's views and efforts on climate change since the 1970s, and evidence of its uncertainty campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s.\" The White House Correspondents Association awarded Inside Climate News a share in the 2016 Edgar A.

      "content": "6.## Conclusion\nAt the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, leaders from 194 countries of the world unanimously acknowledged the serious threat posed by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; surely, there can no longer be any serious doubt about the reality of this threat. Item 7c of Article 7 of the Paris Climate Agreement (Item 7c of Article 7) recommends: ‘Strengthening scientific knowledge on climate, including research, systematic observation of the climate system and early warning systems, in a manner that informs climate services and supports decision making’. I myself would put it more strongly: Climate science must now step up a gear to provide reliable estimates of the climate of the coming decades, including climate extremes, on both global and regional scales, which are as sharp as possible. But we cannot do this without a step change in our modelling capabilities, and my view is that this will not be achieved without a more collaborative approach to climate model development. However, climate scientists must first come together and decide, independent of the politics of international collaboration and the politics of climate change, whether the scientific case for a more collaborative approach to climate model development can be made. If the climate research community can speak with one voice-as it does, for example, in the IPCC assessment reports-then the job is half done.\n",

      "content": "Clearly, there is a cautionary tale told by the hockey stick curve in the unprecedented warming that we are causing, but the lessons from the paleoclimate record of the Common Era (CE) go far beyond that. What might we infer, for example, about the role of dynamical mechanisms relevant to climate change impacts today from their past responses to natural drivers? Examples are the El Niño phenomenon, the Asian summer monsoon, and the North Atlantic Ocean “conveyor belt” circulation. Are there potential “tipping point” elements within these climate subsystems? How has sea level changed in past centuries, and what does it tell us about future coastal risk? Are there natural long-term oscillations, evident in the paleoclimate record, that might compete with human-caused climate change today? Can we assess the “sensitivity” of the climate to ongoing human-caused increases in greenhouse gas concentrations from examining how climate has responded to natural factors in the past? Also, can better estimates of past trends inform assessments of how close we are to critical “dangerous” warming thresholds? In this article, I seek to address such questions and offer thoughts about ways forward to more confident answers.\n\n## A Longer, Sturdier Hockey Stick\nIn the two decades since the original “hockey stick” works of Mann et al. [1998 (1) and 1999 (2), often referred to as “MBH98” and “MBH99,” corresponding to authors Mann, Bradley, and Hughes, respectively], which extended back to 1000 CE, far more paleoclimate data have become available, more sophisticated methods have been developed and applied to these data, and longer reconstructions have been achieved using lower-resolution but considerably longer paleoclimate proxy records. The net result is a veritable “hockey league” (3, 4)-dozens of independent studies that come to similar conclusions and a longer, sturdier hockey stick ([fig01]). Updated reconstructions show the recent warming to be anomalous in an even longer-term context, at least the past two millennia and more tentatively, the past 20,000 y (5, 6), than originally concluded two decades ago by Mann et al. (2). Studies using climate models driven by estimated natural (volcanic and solar) and anthropogenic forcing demonstrate that only the latter can explain this unprecedented warming trend (3).\n\nFrom the standpoint of the public climate change discourse, these conclusions are significant. They underscore the profound, unprecedented impact human activity-fossil fuel burning in particular-is having on our planet. From a scientific standpoint, however, some of the more important insights-insights that indeed motivated the original work of MBH98-involve past patterns of variability and what they can tell us about the dynamics of the climate system and the response to external drivers or “forcings.” We explore these insights in the following section.\n\n## Dynamical Mechanisms and Responses\nMany of the key impacts of climate change involve dynamical components of the climate system and their response to anthropogenic climate forcing. These include the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which influences weather patterns around the world, impacting western US drought and Atlantic hurricane activity among other phenomena. These include the Arctic Oscillation (AO) or closely related North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which impact weather patterns in North America and Eurasia. They also include the Asian summer monsoon upon which more than a billion people depend for their freshwater supply. Finally, there is the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), often termed the “ocean conveyor belt” circulation. The AMOC delivers warm water to the high latitudes of the North Atlantic, warming neighboring regions and circulating nutrients to North Atlantic surface waters while suppressing sea level along parts of the US East Coast.\nWe can better understand these key dynamical components of the climate system and their potential role in climate change by studying how they have responded to past natural drivers, such as volcanic and solar radiative forcing. Moreover, we can assess whether dramatic changes in these systems are underway today by comparing recent trends against the record of the past one to two millennia.\n<FG id='fig01'>\n**Figure 1**: Fig. 1.\n<F href='pnas.2112797118fig01.jpg'>\nComparison of temperature reconstructions spanning the CE including the original Mann et al.

      "content": "# Reelin Shows Promise for Healing Both Gut and Depression\n\nSummary: A new study reveals that the protein Reelin may hold the key to treating both “leaky gut” and major depressive disorder. Chronic stress lowers Reelin levels in the gut, weakening the intestinal barrier and allowing toxins to trigger inflammation that worsens depression.\n\nResearchers found that a single injection of Reelin restored normal levels, strengthening gut integrity and potentially improving mood. The findings suggest a powerful new therapeutic approach that targets the gut–brain axis to heal both body and mind.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n- Dual-Action Protein: Reelin regulates both brain and gut health, restoring intestinal integrity and supporting mood balance.\n\n- Stress Connection: Chronic stress reduces Reelin in the gut, leading to inflammation and worsening depression.\n\n- Therapeutic Potential: A single injection of Reelin normalized gut levels and showed antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models.\n\nSource: University of Victoria\n\nWhat if a protein could be injected to help heal both “leaky gut” and severe depression?\n\nNew research from the University of Victoria (UVic), published in Chronic Stress, shows that a glycoprotein called Reelin may one day be able to do just that.\n\nIn a healthy body, the gastrointestinal system — which includes stomach, colon, and intestines, and is often referred to as the “gut” — controls which nutrients enter the bloodstream.\n\nWhen a person experiences chronic stress, or a stress-related condition such as major depressive disorder (MDD), the gut barrier can become more permeable.\n\nThis “leaky gut” can then allow harmful bacteria and toxins to enter circulation, which can lead to an immune system reaction and inflammation. This can further exacerbate symptoms of depression. Treatments that restore the integrity of the gut barrier may therefore be helpful in preventing MDD.\n\nReelin-based therapeutics could potentially offer such treatment, according to Hector Caruncho, professor of medical sciences at UVic and corresponding author on the study. Reelin is a protein that is found throughout the human body, including in the brain, blood, liver and intestines.\n\n“This study aimed to understand the role of Reelin in the gut, especially under conditions of chronic stress,” says Caruncho. “The gut-brain axis is becoming essential to understanding many psychiatric disorders, including depression.”\n\nThe study found that chronic stress decreased Reelin in the intestines of preclinical models, and that a single injection of 3 µg of Reelin normalized levels.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder have less Reelin in their brains, as do rodents exposed to chronic stress, and that a single intravenous injection of 3 µg of Reelin can produce antidepressant-like effects in these rodents. They have also shown Reelin to be necessary for proper gut lining renewal.\n\n“Taken together, these results may have important implications for the management of major depressive disorder,” says Ciara Halvorson, neuroscience PhD student at UVic, and first author on the paper.\n\n“This is especially true for people who live with both depression and gastrointestinal conditions.\n\n“Under healthy conditions, the gut lining is renewed every four to five days. This is important as the cells in the gut lining are constantly exposed to damaging factors in the gut.\n\n“If Reelin protects against leaky gut by supporting the renewal of the gut lining, Reelin may thereby protect against the worsening of depression symptoms triggered by inflammatory immune responses to leaked gut material.”\n\nWhile more research is needed before Reelin will be available in the clinic, these findings position Reelin as a promising new treatment for depression that targets processes in both the brain and the gut.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).\n\n### Key Questions Answered:\n\nA: Reelin is a glycoprotein found throughout the body that supports neuron function, regulates the gut barrier, and promotes tissue renewal.\n\nA: Chronic stress can cause “leaky gut,” letting toxins enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammation that contributes to depressive symptoms.\n\nA: By repairing gut integrity and improving brain chemistry simultaneously, Reelin could become a dual-target treatment for depression and gut disorders.\n\n## About this depression and microbiome research news\n\nAuthor: Heather WalmsleySource: University of VictoriaContact: Heather Walmsley – University of VictoriaImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.“An Intravenous Injection of Reelin Rescues Endogenous Reelin Expression and Epithelial Cell Apoptosis in the Small Intestine Following Chronic Stress” by Ciara Halvorson et al. Chronic Stress\n\nAbstract\n\nAn Intravenous Injection of Reelin Rescues Endogenous Reelin Expression and Epithelial Cell Apoptosis in the Small Intestine Following Chronic Stress\n\nChronic stress disrupts the integrity of the gut environment, including leaking of the intestinal epithelium.\n\nReelin, an extracellular matrix protein, is released from cells of the lamina propria and promotes epithelial cell proliferation and migration up the crypt-villus axis to facilitate renewal of the gut lining.\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated Reelin expression and apoptosis in the small intestine of Long Evan’s rats treated with recombinant Reelin (3 µg) or vehicle following 3 weeks of daily corticosterone (40 mg/kg/day) or vehicle injections.\n\nWe show that Reelin- and cleaved caspase-3- immunoreactive cells are diminished in the lamina propria or epithelial cells of the gut lining following chronic stress (∼ 50% and 55%, respectively), and that a single injection of 3 µg of Reelin delivered intravenously can reverse these parameters.\n\nWe also found Reelin cell counts in the small intestine did not correlate to counts in the hippocampus regardless of exposure to chronic stress or Reelin treatment.\n\nOur results suggest that Reelin may serve a protective function over gut barrier integrity through the restoration of epithelial cell turnover, and that Reelin may have a role in reversing chronic stress-induced changes to the gut environment.\n\n### Hunger, Fear, and the Brain’s Hidden Switch to Turn Off Chronic Pain\n\n### Social Inference Could Be the Key to Healing Schizophrenia\n\n### Human Brain-on-a-Chip Reveals How Inflammation Breaks the Mind\n\n### Why Comfort Food Feels Like Medicine for People in Chronic Pain",

      "content": "## Introduction\nNeuroscience is an exciting research field, and many recent discoveries have informed paradigm-shifts and innovations. For instance, the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Professors John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser, neuroscientists who discovered place cells and grid cells that form a built-in, global positioning system inside the brain (O'keefe and Burgess, [26]; Moser et al., [24]). Indeed, neuroscience research has received substantial support across the globe. In the United States, the Human Connectome Project was launched in 2009 (Battery, [2]), followed by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative in 2013 (Insel et al., [11]). Concurrently, the Human Brain Project was initiated in Europe (Markram, [23]). In Japan, the Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS) program started in 2014, and the Brain Science and Brain-Like Intelligence Technology project will soon be officially launched by China, though significant preliminary research has already been done (Grillner et al., [9]). With these abundant investments in neuroscience in recent years, more explorative, fundamental or basic research could be conducted, which eventually led to today's paradigm shifts-or paradigm shifts yet to come. For instance, the emergence of brain connectivity studies (Friston, [6]) in recent years may enable us to compare and contrast the normal and diseased brains, and thus identify abnormal brain connectivity patterns as potential biomarkers for neurologic diseases. These advances in the neuroscience field not only drive significant progress in brain biology but also confer practical implications to medicine. We should evaluate and track the changes regarding the landscape of neuroscience research, to indicate evolution regarding research directions, health care priorities and prime translational research topics over a defined period. Such information enables stakeholders to clearly and quickly identify the most influential research works and incorporate the latest evidence into research-informed education.\nBibliometric studies could provide relevant evaluations and assessments of the social and scientific relevance of a specific discipline or research field of interest (López-Muñoz et al., [22], [21]). There have been numerous bibliometric studies on the performance of neuroscience research outputs in specific countries, including China (Xu et al., [40]), India (Shahabuddin, [28]) and Sweden (Glänzel et al., [8]). In addition, similar studies have been conducted in relevant research fields such as psychiatry and psychopharmacology (López-Muñoz et al., [22], [21]). However, to our knowledge, no published study has reported overall changes in the landscape of neuroscience literature across the globe over the last decade.\nTherefore, the aims of this study was to identify the most productive core journals in the field from 2006 to 2015, determine the research terms with the highest citation impact, and compare the publication shares of research areas and contributing countries across these 10 years.\n",

      "content": "This Research Topic highlights recent advancements in our understanding of basic processes in cellular neuroscience with a special focus on pathological mechanisms that could lead to the development of promising new therapeutic strategies in the future. Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in translational neuroscience research, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell function in the nervous system in health and disease, partially spurred by well-funded research consortia. Undoubtedly, translational research is one of the most pressing matters in neuroscience. However, so far, big promised breakthroughs like curing Alzheimer's or understanding superior cognitive processes are not only lacking but seem to be even more distant than ever. Likely due to these unrealistic promises of the past of what neuroscience would be able to achieve by now, other more incremental but nonetheless fundamental advances have yet to reach broader public awareness. Partially, these advances have been enabled by improvements in research techniques like somatic cell reprogramming or single-cell RNA-sequencing that have gradually become more accessible to the research community worldwide. By using these techniques and employing them on very different research questions, new experiments have been performed and amounts of data collected that were hard to imagine only a couple of years ago. This current state of the art will define the (technical) progress that needs to be made in the next decade.\n\nThis Research Topic comprises a balanced mix of original research and review articles that contribute to current views as well as challenges and future perspectives in different fields of the neurosciences, such as the study of peripheral nervous system inflammation through transcriptomic analysis and molecular mechanisms of blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Brain development and function have been approached in relation to the role of the environment and the contribution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis. The potential of transcranial stimulation to improve brain plasticity has been examined and a novel model for controlling synaptic transmission proposed. Finally, somatic cell reprogramming has been examined for treating spinal cord injury. This topic sheds light on the techniques and current knowledge in the field that might soon lead to new therapies to understand and treat brain dysfunctions.\n\nThe study by [Liu et al.]() investigates inflammatory transcriptional alterations of mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons. By using single-cell RNA sequencing in the peripheral system of mice this original research paper revealed the heterogeneity of trigeminal neurons and their diverse neuronal transcriptomic responses to orofacial inflammation. Orofacial pain is a debilitating pain condition and a serious public health problem (Banigo et al., [1]). The observed heterogeneity in trigeminal ganglion neurons is surprising given that classically besides of their area of innervation, these neurons were considered relatively homogenous. The results of the present study might provide new ideas for the development of therapeutic strategies for orofacial inflammatory pain.\n\nThe review by [Chen et al.]() shed light on the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and its role in blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Ferroptosis, which in recent years has attracted more and more attention due to its possible role in nervous system disorders, is a cell death mode caused by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation accumulation (Li et al., [4]). The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from dangerous chemicals in the bloodstream thereby maintaining a tightly regulated microenvironment for neuronal signaling. Recently it has been shown that lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation are related to barrier dysfunction. This review examines the relationship between ferroptosis and blood-brain barrier dysfunction which may reveal new targets for the treatment of brain diseases.\n\nThe importance of epigenetics, the regulation of gene expression by environmental factors independently of DNA sequences, has constantly increased in recent years. The article by [Vázquez-Ágredos et al.]() provides a systemic review of epigenetic regulation of the environmental impact on adolescent neurobehavioral development. Adolescent behavior is not only characterized by novelty-seeking but also by increased stress responsivity (Spear, [6]) and early life stress has been linked to a higher risk for alcohol and drug use disorders (Kirsch and Lippard, [3]). This review focuses on the miRNA expression patterns in the rodent brain with a special interest in the impact of stress and drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine, cannabis, and ketamine. The authors point to a dynamic epigenetic network sensitive to environmental events with distinctive changes across adolescence. A deeper understanding of environmental threats during this critical period in neurodevelopment is fundamental for the understanding of psychiatric and addictive disorders emerging at this stage.\n\nOther external factors such as diets or alcohol consumption can impact brain function *via* the gut-brain axis. The original research article by [Higarza et al.]() proposes an important extension namely the liver-gut-brain axis. They investigated the dynamic changes of gut microbiota in different rodent models along the liver disease spectrum and found that liver damage affected the diversity and bacterial community structure. Moreover, they investigated potential changes in brain metabolism and cognition. They found changes in brain oxidative metabolism in many brain areas including the prefrontal, retrosplenial, and perirhinal cortices, as well as the amygdala and mammillary bodies, potentially accounting for the observed impact on working memory. In the future, gut microbiota could be more specifically targeted to design more effective treatments, for specific stages of liver disease.\n",

      "content": "### Oncology and Neuroscience\nThe combination of neuroscience and oncology has produced new ideas for preserving cognitive function throughout cancer therapy. El-Khatib et al. ([42]) found that in a mouse model, synaptic plasticity and cognitive function were preserved by brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) following cranial irradiation. Cranial radiation often causes cognitive decline from hippocampal damage; therefore, BDNF-based therapies could reduce these negative consequences and improve the quality of life for cancer sufferers (El-Khatib et al. [42]).\nOther studies suggest that concentrating on neurogenesis-promoting pathways, including Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling, may further enhance neuroprotective effects after radiation (Antonelli et al. [4]).\n\n### Psychiatric Neuromodulation\nTechniques of neuromodulation-including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-are rapidly gaining prominence as adjunctive treatment in psychiatry. Findings from the NExT experiment by Conelea et al. ([32]) on the effectiveness of TMS aimed targeting OCD-related circuits to enhance the outcomes of exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment in adolescent OCD patients are presented. Aiming to control damaged frontostriatal circuits, this combined TMS-ERP approach could improve patient participation in behavioral therapy as well as symptom severity (Conelea et al. [32]).\nApart from OCD, creative TMS protocols are being researched for sadness, PTSD, and substance use disorders, showing promise for circuit-specific neuromodulation treatment (Cole et al. [31]).\n\n### Using Stem Cells in Neural Regeneration\nYuan and Zhang ([196]) investigate the intricacies of human neuronal transplantation into damaged or sick brain tissue. Successful integration depends on developmental synchronicity between transplanted neurons and host circuitry, favorable extracellular circumstances, and appropriate guiding cues. They caution that problems such as aberrant circuit formation, immunological rejection, and tumorigenicity have to be carefully handled. Advances in gene editing and nanomaterials, meantime, are making the possibility of functional recovery by neuronal replacement more and more practical (Yuan and Zhang [196]).\nCreative approaches are being developed to improve the accuracy and safety of these regenerative techniques by using pre-patterned neuronal subtypes or biomimetic scaffolds (Giandomenico and Lancaster [51]).\nThe therapy of neurological illnesses is being changed by developments in circuit-specific interventions, neuromodulation, immune-targeted medications, and stem cell therapies. The combination of regenerative medicine with sophisticated neural circuit mapping technologies offers hopeful prospects for the restoration of brain function in formerly unmanageable circumstances. Realizing the full promise of these drugs will, therefore, depend on ongoing translational research, ethical issues, and rigorous clinical testing.\n\n## Conclusion\nModern developments in neural circuit mapping tools including optogenetics, chemogenetics, and advanced neuromodulation techniques including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have changed our ability to precisely map, control, and alter separate brain circuits. By providing strong routes for the creation of circuit-specific therapy procedures, these tools have greatly improved our understanding of the fundamental ideas governing brain function and dysfunction.\nWhile chemogenetics offers long-lasting, non-invasive modulation, optogenetics allows precise temporal control of neuronal populations, hence allowing scientists to examine the activities of particular neural circuits in health and illness. While new adaptive, closed-loop systems provide better therapeutic accuracy, the clinical use of neuromodulation technologies-including TMS and deep brain stimulation-is transforming the therapy of mental and neurological disorders.\nSophisticated drug delivery systems and stem cell therapy inclusion improve these developments. Stem cells not only have the ability to repair damaged neurons but also increase neuroplasticity and support neurological recovery. Innovative drug delivery systems including nanoparticle-mediated and focused ultrasound-guided ones provide exact control of brain circuits, hence improving treatment effectiveness and lowering systemic side effects.\nHighly tailored therapies in neurology and psychiatry are being built on the combination of circuit mapping technologies, regenerative medicine, exact neuromodulation, and sophisticated drug delivery. These developments indicate a change toward drugs that aim the particular network dysfunctions driving brain diseases, thereby possibly boosting recovery outcomes and raising patients’ quality of life. Continuous innovation-including the integration of artificial intelligence, human brain organoid models, and wireless neuromodulation devices-is set to improve existing approaches and hasten the development of precision neuromedicine.\n",

      "content": "*d. Machine Learning Tools for Understanding Complex Hippocampal Patterns in Learning and Memory.* Andrea Navas-Olive (IST-Austria) presented new machine learning tools for analyzing electrophysiological data, with a specific focus on sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), which are crucially involved in memory consolidation. She discussed challenges in detecting SWRs due to the variability in their statistics, and how traditional spectral methods might bias the types of events that are detected. Employing machine learning techniques, she and her colleagues have developed algorithms that improve detection performance, while reducing dependency on often arbitrarily selected thresholds which can bias the characteristics of detected events54. These algorithms are not only applicable across different areas of the brain but also generalize to other species, demonstrating their potential for broad applications in neuroscience research55. The innovative aspects of this work extend beyond the development of sophisticated detection algorithms; they also encompass the collaborative, crowd-sourced approach to problem-solving behind the project. Navas-Olive co-organized the BrainCode Games hackathon, engaging a diverse group of participants from various backgrounds to tackle the challenge of SWR detection. This collaborative effort not only led to the creation of multiple effective machine learning models, but also fostered the development of a community of interdisciplinary researchers and industry professionals united by a common goal. The hackathon's success highlights the value of inclusive, community-driven research endeavors for generating unbiased, comprehensive solutions to shared problems. Thus, in addition to producing significant scientific findings, this work also showcased a novel approach for engaging a broad spectrum of talents to advance neuroscience research56 .\n\n*e. Neural Ensemble & HBP/EBRAINS Knowledge Graph.* Andrew Davison (Université Paris-Saclay/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) focused on the achievements of the Human Brain Project (HBP) and its integration in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph57, two initiatives aimed at advancing digital neuroscience. The HBP, a decadelong EU-funded project with a budget of approximately 600 million Euros brought together over 500 researchers and 100 universities to push the boundaries of science and engineering in pursuit of understanding the human brain. A culminating outcome of this project was the establishment of EBRAINS, a comprehensive research infrastructure offering digital tools and services for neuroscientists. Davison highlighted the transformative potential of EBRAINS for facilitating datadriven science, emphasizing its role in providing sustainable, high-quality digital resources for the neuroscience community. The EBRAINS Knowledge Graph, a core component of this infrastructure, serves as a universal metadata repository for the project, enhancing data discoverability and interoperability. This digital repository enables the sharing of experimental data, computational models, and software tools, all interconnected within a semantic, linked data framework58,59 . Through its sophisticated architecture and community-driven approach, the EBRAINS initiative exemplifies the importance of collaborative science and open data when tackling the most complex questions in neuroscience.\n\n*f. Concerns & Challenges.* The panel discussion following these talks, moderated by Ryan Ly (Lawrence Berkeley Lab), centered on critical challenges that emerge when developing, maintaining, and sustaining open-source tools for neurophysiology research. Panelists shared their personal experiences and the various hurdles they've encountered, such as transitioning project responsibilities, securing funding, and fostering community engagement. A recurring theme was the essential role of financial support in not only developing these tools, but also in hiring dedicated personnel to maintain and promote these resources, and support potential users. Despite these challenges, there was an underlying optimism about the future, with mentions of the field's gradually improving recognition of the importance of funding open-source software development. The key takeaways covered a variety of topics, including:\n[]",

This technique allows us to peer in the brain of live mice or cultured brain cells and to record ongoing cellular processes in real time. We are learning vital information on dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons. Dendritic spines: cortical pyramidal neurons, express tens of thousands of small protuberances on their dendritic trees. These dynamic structures receive excitatory information from other neurons, and play a significant role in cognition. It is believed that changes in spine number or morphology precede the cognitive cascade in many neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n#### Fruits\nPatients with schizophrenia, for example, present with decrease in basal dendrites and spines in layers three and five, especially in area nine of the brain. Techniques to measure dendritic spine density are emerging as new biological markers of the disease (1). Novel neuroprotective compounds and techniques (such as electrical stimulation) seem to increase dendrites and spines, especially in the hippocampus.\n\n### Optogenetics\nOptogenetics is an *in vivo* technique that came about by combining genetics and optics to control events within brain cells. This is how it works: genes coding for light sensitive or fluorescent proteins are inserted into the mouse DNA. Part of the rodent’s skull is replaced by a transparent material, creating a window through which the brain is visualized. This technique allows scientists not only to see the light sensitive proteins at work in a moving mouse, but also to switch on and off (via light) various neural circuits.\n\n#### Fruits\nUsing optogenetics, scientists were able to manipulate EEG gamma oscillations (~40 Hz) thought to be crucial for cognition in schizophrenia. Optogenetics has also been combined with fMRI. Optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) is a novel approach that combines optogenetic control of neural circuits with high-field functional MRI, creating a powerful tool that can monitor and influence neural activity arising from specific circuits in any area of interest (2).\n\n### “I cannot see a string, but I can see a cable” (white matter tractography)\nWe can see individual neurons (in cultures or brain) by microscopy only, they cannot be seen in real time *in vivo* in the brain.\nWhy not? The best MRI machines now-a-days have a resolution of about 1 mm. The problem is that 1 mm of brain tissue contains about 1,000 neurons.\nWhat about axons? The good news is that axons travel together forming thick cables. Large cables, like corpus callosum, can be seen by naked eye. Thinner ones (more than 1 mm) can be picked by MRI and thus can be seen *in vivo* in real time. That is how white matter tractography originated. The human connectome project is a very ambitious plan of mapping the entire white matter (“cables” that connect brain regions) in healthy and diseased brains. Wernicke (3) was the first to posit that abnormal connections among brain regions may play a critical role in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n\n#### Fruits\nIt is currently believed that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental brain dysconnection syndrome, involving abnormal interactions between widespread brain networks. Accumulating evidence from a growing number of neuroimaging studies have begun to identify heritable biomarkers of this complex disorder. Current studies demonstrate both reduced and enhanced connectivity among several brain areas, including dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPF) with the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, hippocampal formation, thalamus and cerebellum, cingulate cortex, and also limbic regions (particularly amygdala-frontal connections) (4). There are novel rehabilitation techniques that seem to help the brain “rewire” to a certain extent during adult life.\n\n### Schizophrenia in a petri dish (cultured neurons)\nNeuropsychiatric disorders can be studied more effectively thanks to a new method for obtaining mature neurons from reprogramed skin cells. Researchers can take skin cells from living patients and convert them into neurons or astrocytes that mimic the activity of the patient’s own brain cells. These studies have demonstrated the collaborative role between neurons and astrocytes in human cognition. Astrocytes participate in glutamatergic tripartite synapses that support cognitive functions, such as learning, perception, conscious integration, memory formation, and retrieval.\n\n#### Fruits\nIn the past few years the classical view of astrocytes as a simple supportive cell for neurons, has been replaced by a new vision in which glial cells are active elements of the brain. For example, neurons grown *in vitro* along with astrocytes differentiate more rapidly and form many more synapses than neurons grown alone. This raises the possibility that astrocytes may be as important, or even more important than neurons, not only during brain development, but also in its day to day function and cognition. Targeting astrocyte receptors and pathology is rapidly becoming a novel area of interest in cognitive disorders (5).\n",
