      "content": "# The Current State of Federal Funding for Pancreatic Cancer Research: A Call to Action\n\nby Carly Eskin — Sep 10, 2025\n\n## New! — Government Shutdown Halts Research Progress\n\nAt midnight on September 30, federal spending lapsed. With no deal reached on either a short-term funding patch or full–year appropriations bills for the new fiscal year, many government operations have now shut down.\n\nThis shutdown is not just a political standoff – it has real consequences for patients and research progress. Already this year, the threats of funding cuts, freezes, staff terminations and prolonged uncertainty have slowed research. Now, with the government closed:\n\n- New patients aren’t being admitted to the NIH Clinical Center.\n\n- Critical work to advance scientific discovery is frozen.\n\n- New research grants are not being issued.\n\n- Agency staff are furloughed.\n\n- Training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at NIH facilities has stopped.\n\nFor patients with pancreatic cancer and their families, time is the one thing they don’t have to spare. Every delay in research means lost opportunities for progress.\n\nThat’s why we need your voice now more than ever. Tell Congress to reopen the federal government and finalize spending bills that include increases for pancreatic cancer research. Science cannot advance without funding – researchers, patients and families need stability, not shutdowns.\n\nTogether, we must keep pushing for action by taking action.\n\n## 9/10/2025 — House Joins Senate in Supporting Medical Research\n\nThanks to you and your continued advocacy, Congress is showing bipartisan recognition of the importance of investing in medical research.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nHouse Moves Forward on Research Funding\n\nLast week, the House Labor-HHS subcommittee marked up its appropriations bill and reported it out of committee – rejecting the steep cuts proposed by the administration. In a strong signal of bipartisan support, lawmakers once again prioritized medical research.\n\nYesterday, the full House Appropriations Committee advanced the bill. While the increases we saw in the Senate bill were not included, the House did maintain flat funding levels for NIH and NCI, preventing harmful cuts.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nTogether, the House and Senate actions demonstrate that both parties continue to recognize the value of investing in biomedical research. These investments protect the nation’s scientific infrastructure, keep the peer-review grant-making process moving without disruption and help ensure that appropriated funds are fully obligated to researchers who rely on them.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nWhile this progress is encouraging, there is still urgent work to do. Current federal funding expires on September 30, and researchers need certainty to keep moving forward on discoveries and treatments.\n\nWe must continue to urge Congress to finish the job and pass appropriations bills into law – so that pancreatic cancer research, and all medical research, can continue without interruption.\n\nEvery investment made today fuels tomorrow’s progress. Together, we’ll keep making sure pancreatic cancer research remains a national priority.\n\n## 8/7/2025 — Progress Toward a Big Goal, But Our Work Continues\n\nAs Congress adjourns for its August recess, we want to thank you for your ongoing advocacy and provide an important update on where things stand for pancreatic cancer research funding.\n\nYour calls and emails to Congress have made a real difference. Because of the dedication of PanCAN advocates like you across the country, we’ve seen encouraging developments on Capitol Hill. But, we’re also entering a critical stretch, and we can’t let up now.\n\nMajor Milestone in the Senate Defense Bill\n\nFor the first time ever, the Senate Appropriations Committee included a dedicated line item for pancreatic cancer in its version of the Defense spending bill. This is a direct result of your advocacy and a great step forward. The bill matches the House’s funding level, restoring $15 million for the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP). We’re particularly grateful to the chair and vice chair of the Defense Subcommittee for their leadership.\n\nMedical Research Funding Wins in Senate LHHS Bill\n\nIn a bipartisan rebuke of proposed cuts from the administration, the Senate Appropriations Committee prioritized medical research in its Labor, Health, and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS) bill. It included:\n\n- $400 million increase for National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\n- $150 million increase for National Cancer Institute (NCI)\n\n- Oversight language aimed at protecting the structure and grant-making capacity of the NIH\n\nWe want to thank members of the Appropriations Committee for working in a bipartisan manner and are especially grateful to those members who voiced strong support during the markup, underscoring the power of Congress to protect critical research priorities.\n\nCautious Optimism – But Challenges Remain\n\nYou should feel energized by these victories and proud of the leadership role our community played. But it’s important to stay focused. The House and Senate are now recessed until September, and no final decisions have been made. NIH funding levels remain unstable, and past threats of cuts have already had chilling effects on research planning, staffing and long-term investments in science.\n\nYour advocacy continues to matter. We’ve seen growing bipartisan concern about the administration’s proposed $18 billion cut to NIH. And senators are pressing for already-appropriated funds to be spent as Congress intended – we’re staying in close contact with their offices to reinforce our message. We’ll continue to push the House to follow the Senate’s lead as they prepare to mark up their version of the Labor-HHS-Education bill in September.\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nMomentum is on our side. PanCAN advocates will continue to meet and share their stories with key members of Congress, underscoring what cutting funding now means ending promising research during the August recess. We’ll be back in touch when the House takes up its Labor-HHS bill so you can let your representative know that strong, stable research funding must remain a national priority.\n\nAgain, thank you for your boldness. At a time when federal research funding is uncertain, you inspire so many with your action.\n\nNow is not the time to take the foot of the gas – let’s keep the pressure on.\n\n## 7/3/25 − You Helped Secure More Support of Increased Research Funding!\n\nYou helped the pancreatic cancer community take a big step forward in securing increased federal funding for research! Thanks to dedicated PanCAN advocates like you, 26 senators signed on to the bipartisan pancreatic cancer Dear Colleague letter urging increased funding for the dedicated Pancreatic Cancer Research Program in FY26!\n\nThis is a significant achievement in this budget climate, and it wouldn’t have been possible without you. You took action and showed lawmakers that pancreatic cancer research must remain a national priority − especially now that research is on the cusp of breakthroughs to help patients live.\n\nThere’s still a long road ahead − funding bills are currently being written in the House, but the Senate has not yet scheduled any of their bill markups. This means we don’t know yet when or how the Senate will respond as they draft their bills.\n\nWe’ll be sure to let you know when the next moment for action arrives − because your voices together continue to be the most powerful tool we have to drive progress.\n\nFor now, take a moment to celebrate this milestone. Twenty-six signatures is a meaningful show of bipartisan support − and a testament to what’s possible when we work together.\n\nThank you for changing the story of this disease.\n\n## 6/13/25\n\nEarlier this week we had the chance to report on the strong bipartisan support PanCAN advocates generated in the House for restoring the dedicated Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP) in FY26 after its elimination in FY25. Today, we see the direct impact of that bipartisan support as the FY26 House Defense Appropriations bill includes $15 million for PCARP!\n\nIn today’s tough budget climate, restoring funding to FY24 levels is a major win – and a direct result of thousands of advocates who have contacted Congress in support of pancreatic cancer research funding over the past few months.\n\nThis is a huge step forward – but it’s not over yet.\n\nNext, the bill heads to the full House for a vote. Additionally, the Senate still needs to propose and pass their version of the FY26 Defense Appropriations bill and then both chambers need to agree on the final version of the bill. Through all of that, the job of the PanCAN community is to make sure Congress knows how important it is to keep this funding in until the bill becomes law. We’ll need your continued support in the coming months to make that happen.\n\nThank you for raising your voice, pushing for change, and helping to deliver hope for everyone affected by this devastating disease. Let’s keep the momentum going!\n\n## 6/10/25\n\nThanks to the incredible advocacy of PanCAN community members like you, 113 bipartisan members of the House signed on to the Sewell-J Joyce pancreatic cancer FY26 Dear Colleague letter to support not only restoring the dedicated Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP) but increasing funding to $25 million. This is a tremendous milestone – especially in a new Congress with many new members – and it shows just how powerful your voices are on Capitol Hill!\n\nBecause of your actions, Congress is taking notice.\n\nNext, the House Appropriations Committee will decide whether the FY26 Department of Defense spending bill they will send to the House floor for a vote will include PCARP funding. PanCAN advocates whose representatives serve on the relevant subcommittee are reaching out to those representatives, highlighting the strong bipartisan support to include PCARP in the bill and demand this funding be made a priority.\n\nEven if you don’t live in a key district, you can still take action today. If your representative didn’t sign the letter, they will get a message reminding them of our priorities. And, if your representative did sign the letter, they’ll receive an automatic thank-you message. Every message helps amplify our voice.\n\nThis is an exciting and meaningful step towards restoring dedicated pancreatic cancer research funding, but we have more work ahead to achieve this and to protect critical investments at the National Cancer Institute, the largest funder of pancreatic cancer research in the world.\n\nYour continued engagement will be essential. Together, we can change the future of this disease.\n\n## 5/16/25 – Congress Must Restore & Increase Dedicated Pancreatic Cancer Research Funding in FY26\n\nThe pancreatic cancer community hit a major setback when FY25 funding for the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP) – the only federal program dedicated solely to researching pancreatic cancer – was eliminated. But, there’s still reason to be hopeful.\n\nWe recently learned that pancreatic cancer has been included as an eligible disease under the Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program (PRCRP), so pancreatic cancer researchers have an opportunity to apply for this funding. It shows that Congress has been listening – and that your voice matters.\n\nStill, this isn’t enough. Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers, and it demands dedicated, sustained and increased federal investment. That’s why we’re focused on restoring PCARP funding in FY26 – and growing it to $25 million.\n\nRight now, a letter is circulating in the Senate that calls for this funding restoration. The more members who sign on, the stronger the message we send.\n\nHelp protect progress by getting your senators’ signatures on this letter. Sending our pre-written message is fast and easy – and your action could be the reason this funding gets restored! Share how you’ve been affected by pancreatic cancer and how much accelerating progress means to you by personalizing our pre-written message. Then, follow the prompt to call your members of Congress to make your voice literally heard!\n\n## 5/8/25 Update\n\nFederal research saves lives! Yesterday, PanCAN President and CEO Julie Fleshman was joined by leading researchers Joseph Kim, MD, of UK Markey Cancer Center, Steven D. Leach, MD, of Dartmouth Cancer Center, and J. Bart Rose, MD, MAS, of UAB Department of Surgery Division of Surgical Oncology and delivered that message directly to Capitol Hill – on behalf of every individual affected by pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn response to the administration’s proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the elimination of the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP), this group of experts voiced their concerns about the compounding devastation to pancreatic cancer research today and in the future.\n\nThey met with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to discuss the critical role federally funded cancer research has played in growing the research field, improving survival and the overall research ecosystem. We are seeing the return on investment, and our community cannot afford setbacks.\n\nWe urge Congress to sustain funding increases at the NIH, National Cancer Institute (NCI) and PCARP within the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program.\n\nCongress must hear us: We expect action. We expect progress. And we will not back down.\n\n## 5/2/2025 – The Administration’s Proposed Budget Cuts Threaten Critical Pancreatic Cancer Research\n\nPresident Trump’s newly released FY26 budget proposes a devastating $17.5 billion or about 37% cut to the National Institutes of Health, which includes the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThis is a staggering reduction that will have a devastating impact on progress for pancreatic cancer. At a time when we should be advancing forward, these cuts will take us backward, jeopardizing the lives of patients today and in the future.\n\nCongress has the power to stop this. But they need to hear from you. Contact your members of Congress today and tell them: Reject cuts to cancer research funding. Because when Congress doesn’t prioritize research, they fail all of you and your community.\n\nEvery dollar slashed is a setback for patients and their families. Behind the research are real people. These cuts don’t just affect labs – they affect lives.\n\nIt will take all of us together to make noise on Capitol Hill. PanCAN President and CEO Julie Fleshman has already written a letter to Congress demanding that funding for cancer research be protected and increased – because patients can’t afford to wait.\n\n## 4/11/25 – Tell your representative to support $25M in research funding!\n\nFY25 funding has been eliminated from the only federal program exclusively researching pancreatic cancer – a program YOU helped create! We must fight to get that funding back in FY26 with an increase.\n\nRight now, members of the U.S. House of Representatives are circulating a bipartisan letter that urges key decision-makers to reinstate Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP) funding in the FY26 budget. The more representatives who sign, the stronger our message: Pancreatic cancer research urgently needs federal research investment.\n\nContact your representative today and urge them to sign this critical letter in support of $25 million for PCARP. A quick message might be what secures your rep’s support. To take an extra step, call your representative to really get the message across. Lawmakers won’t take action on this issue unless they hear from their constituents (that’s you!).\n\nThis is our moment to fight for lifesaving research. Let’s make it happen.\n\n## 3/25/25 – Cuts Won’t Stop Us, We’re Not Giving Up\n\nIt’s not the news we wanted, but it’s news that will make our community fight harder than ever before. As it stands now, the impact of recent cuts to the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) at the Department of Defense (DoD) means the only federal program dedicated exclusively to pancreatic cancer research will receive zero funding for FY25.\n\nHere’s why this matters: Dedicated federal funding drives progress in early detection, better treatments, and hope for patients and families. Without Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP) funding, progress it was fueling comes to a screeching halt.\n\nBut we’re not giving up – we’re working with our Congressional champions now and will be coming back with a bold ask for FY26, very soon.\n\n## 3/14/25 – FY25 Budget Passes, Includes Cuts to Cancer Research – Our Fight Continues\n\nThank you for being part of a passionate community that mobilized in record time to defend and protect cancer research funding. Ultimately, like the House, the Senate approved the FY25 budget bill that includes cuts to the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) by 57%.\n\nWe expect the CDMRP cuts will affect funding at the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP), but as of now, it is unclear by how much.\n\nThis was not the outcome we wanted, but as a community familiar with having to overcome obstacles, we will persist in our fight to protect and increase federal funding for pancreatic cancer research now and in the future.\n\nPCARP only exists because of you and our community. It is still the only federal program that funds research exclusive to pancreatic cancer. Our powerful movement will continue to tell Congress that this funding is critical and needs consistent increases – because federal funding for cancer research saves lives.\n\nTogether, we’ll stay committed to demanding more from Congress for everyone affected by pancreatic cancer. And that means making bold asks.\n\nRight now, PanCAN is engaging our champions in Congress to include a record-breaking amount of funding for PCARP in the FY26 budget. Because less is not an option when it affects the lives of those we love and want to see thrive.\n\nThere’s no stopping now.\n\n## 3/12/25 – House Passes Budget, Includes Cuts to Cancer Research\n\nYesterday, the House passed an FY25 budget bill that slashes funding to the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program by 57%.\n\nResearch for pancreatic cancer is already woefully underfunded, and now the only program exclusively funding pancreatic cancer research is one step closer to devastating cuts.\n\nThe Senate will vote on the budget this week.\n\nAs a community focused on progress, we won’t stand idly by. Don’t let your senators fail science, patients and you.\n\n## 3/10/25 – Tell Congress: Vote NO on Cuts to Pancreatic Cancer Research Funding\n\nCongress is voting this week on a FY25 budget bill to fund the government that cuts cancer research funding for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) at the Department of Defense by more than 50%. These devastating cuts directly threaten innovative research happening at the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program (PCARP) – research that’s vital to help cure one of the deadliest cancers.\n\nAs part of our powerful community, contact your members of Congress and tell them to VOTE NO on cuts.\n\nResearch progress for pancreatic cancer is at a critical turning point. Recent breakthroughs targeting key mutations – impacting more than 90% of pancreatic cancer patients – offer unprecedented hope. These advancements have the potential to finally unlock new treatments that could save lives. But without sustained funding, this progress could come to a grinding halt.\n\nThe CDMRP has played a pivotal role in advancing life-saving research. Cutting this mission-driven program endangers future breakthroughs and jeopardizes the momentum researchers have worked tirelessly to build. For patients and families desperately awaiting new treatments, these cuts would be disastrous.\n\nCongress must reject this proposal and instead pass a full-year FY25 Defense Appropriations Act that fully funds the CDMRP. For Congress, failing to support this critical research is failing constituents like you!\n\nWe urge you to act now. Lives are on the line, and progress cannot wait. Together, we can ensure that research continues, breakthroughs are achieved and hope remains alive for those facing pancreatic cancer.\n\n## 02/24/25\n\nThanks to decades of sustained, predictable federal investments and increases in pancreatic cancer research, the research community is at a tipping point – 2024 saw record-breaking advancements in drug approvals, and patients today are three times more likely to survive than when PanCAN was founded in 1999.\n\nBut pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers, with a five-year survival rate of just 13% – and future progress is now at risk.\n\n### The impact of recent executive actions on current and future pancreatic cancer research progress\n\nFunding freezes, caps on Facilities and Administrative costs and other executive actions have already impacted the pancreatic cancer research community and threaten to dismantle the infrastructure that PanCAN and our community worked so hard to create over the past two decades.\n\nVoices from the pancreatic cancer researcher community are sending a strong message: if these orders are allowed to stand, the consequences will be catastrophic. Today, we are sharing some of their concerns.\n\nThere has been a temporary freeze on federal research grants across various health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), disrupting ongoing projects and creating uncertainty about future funding.\n\n“There are devastating stories coming out of Building 10 at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) where clinical trial participants were unable to enroll in trials,” said one scientist.\n\nA researcher on the frontlines of pancreatic cancer breakthroughs put it bluntly: “Not getting this grant funded in a timely manner will massively impact our momentum on this very promising [new] treatment approach.”\n\nAn abrupt cap on Facilities and Administrative cost reimbursements for all NIH grants is a significant reduction in the investment in research. These costs are essential operational expenses such as maintenance of highly specialized labs, financial and legal compliance officers, chemical safety teams, etc. This cap is a cut to funding, hindering scientific progress by limiting institutions’ ability to conduct research.\n\nOne leading scientist described the impact: “Receiving a grant that covers salaries, supplies, services, and equipment is great, but I can’t perform that research in my living room.”\n\nAnother researcher said, “If the 15% [Facilities and Administrative] cost cap goes through, this will certainly decimate the foundation of academic medicine at many institutions and cancer centers.“\n\n### The Future of Pancreatic Cancer Research\n\nThese recent executive actions are causing confusion and uncertainty, jeopardizing funding for cancer centers doing critical research that would benefit patients and discouraging the next generation of researchers from staying in the field or finding institutions to support their work.\n\n“A talented junior physician scientist is applying for a K01 grant. [There was] a request for additional information for council review. Status is now unclear and the program announcement has been removed.”\n\n“[Some] NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers [that have] been recently approved for their five-year renewal, have still not received their funding even though their last five-year funding cycle ended in 2024. If not remedied immediately, this has the potential to profoundly compromise support for cancer patients, cancer research and cancer clinical trials.”\n\nThere has also been confusion for patients on whether they are able to enroll or participate in clinical trials, which hinders care at a critical time in their disease progression.\n\n### What You Can Do\n\nThis is not just a threat to funding – it is an obstruction of scientific progress. Patients cannot afford delays. Our community, the pancreatic cancer community, must act now.\n\nPanCAN believes in comprehensive federal funding for cancer research – and Congress should, too! The fight against pancreatic cancer cannot – and must not – be stalled. Congress needs to hear your voice now.",

      "content": "## 2. Current state and applications of AI technology\n\n### 2.1. Application of AI technology in scientific research and its latest developments\nRecent years have witnessed significant developments in AI, especially in deep learning, machine learning, and NLP. These advances have not only led to innovative algorithms but also enhanced computing power and data processing efficiency. AI role in scientific research spans from theoretical studies to experimental methodologies (Fig. [F1]).\n\nInnovations in AI algorithms, cutting-edge research show advancements in AI models, especially in neural networks with complex architectures, offering improved data handling and predictive accuracy for unstructured data like images and texts.[6-9]\nGenomic research breakthroughs, AI now plays a pivotal role in genomic research, going beyond data extraction to predicting gene functions and interactions. This evolution aids in understanding complex genetic diseases and tailoring medical treatments, as documented in recent biomedical literature.[10-13] AI Impact on environmental science, machine learning is increasingly employed in environmental science, utilizing satellite imagery and sensor data to model climate change scenarios and monitor ecological changes with unprecedented precision.[14-17] Materials science advancements, in materials science, AI accelerates the discovery of new materials with desired properties, reducing the reliance on extensive laboratory experimentation, as noted in contemporary research papers.[18-20] Robotics integration, the fusion of AI with robotics is revolutionizing experimental research. AI-driven robots can autonomously conduct experiments, dynamically adjusting parameters based on real-time data, thereby enhancing experimental efficiency and reproducibility.[21-24] Applications in social sciences, AI application extends to the social sciences, analyzing large-scale data to decipher patterns in human behavior. This informs public policy and economic strategies, as explored in recent social science research.[25] Ethical considerations and governance, contemporary literature increasingly highlights ethical implications and the need for governance frameworks in AI applications, especially to safeguard data privacy and ensure responsible AI usage in sensitive fields like healthcare.[26-29]\nThese advancements underscore AI transformative role across scientific disciplines, presenting both immense potential and new challenges in research methodology and ethics.\n\n### 2.2. The role of AI in data analysis, literature generation, and experimental design\nIn the realm of data analysis, AI technologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms, excel in processing big data, identifying data patterns, and conducting predictive analysis. For instance, by utilizing AI to analyze environmental data, researchers can predict climate change trends more accurately. This efficient data processing capability makes AI an indispensable tool in scientific research.[30]\nThe advancement of NLP technologies has also made AI pivotal in literature generation. AI tools, such as automatic summary generators and literature management software, assist researchers in efficiently organizing and summarizing vast amounts of scientific literature. This reduces the workload of literature reviews to some extent, allowing researchers to focus more on innovative studies.[31]\nIn experimental design, the application of AI technology significantly enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of experiments. Machine learning algorithms, for example, are used to design and optimize experimental procedures and predict outcomes. In some cases, AI can even automate experimental operations and data collection. This not only accelerates the experimental process but also improves the reliability of the results.[32]\nThese applications demonstrate that AI technology not only plays a supportive role in scientific work but has also become a key driver in advancing science. However, with the widespread application of AI technology, concerns have arisen regarding its potential to contribute to academic misconduct in research. This requires a joint effort from the scientific community and regulatory bodies to ensure the integrity and quality of research.[32]\n<FG id='F1'>\n**Figure 1**: Figure 1.\n<F href='medi-103-e38811-g001.jpg'>\nA visual concept map to outline the application of AI technology in the research lifecycle.

      "content": "Computational archaeology describes computer-based analytical methods for the study of long-term human behaviour and behavioural evolution. As with other sub-disciplines that have prefixed 'computational' to their name (e.g., computational biology, computational physics and computational sociology), the term is reserved for (generally mathematical) methods that could not realistically be performed without the aid of a computer.\n\nComputational archaeology may include the use of geographical information systems (GIS), especially when applied to spatial analyses such as viewshed analysis and least-cost path analysis as these approaches are sufficiently computationally complex that they are extremely difficult if not impossible to implement without the processing power of a computer. Likewise, some forms of statistical and mathematical modelling, and the computer simulation of human behaviour and behavioural evolution using software tools such as Swarm or Repast would also be impossible to calculate without computational aid. The application of a variety of other forms of complex and bespoke software to solve archaeological problems, such as human perception and movement within built environments using software such as University College London's Space Syntax program, also falls under the term 'computational archaeology'.\n\nThe acquisition, documentation and analysis of archaeological finds at excavations and in museums is an important field having pottery analysis as one of the major topics. In this area 3D-acquisition techniques like structured light scanning (SLS), photogrammetric methods like \"structure from motion\" (SfM), computed tomography as well as their combinations provide large data-sets of numerous objects for digital pottery research. These techniques are increasingly integrated into the in-situ workflow of excavations. The Austrian subproject of the Corpus vasorum antiquorum (CVA) is seminal for digital research on finds within museums.\n\nComputational archaeology is also known as \"archaeological informatics\"  (Burenhult 2002, Huggett and Ross 2004) or \"archaeoinformatics\" (sometimes abbreviated as \"AI\", but not to be confused with artificial intelligence).\n\nOrigins and objectives \nIn recent years, it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process. AI science is an emerging discipline that attempts to uncover, quantitatively represent and explore specific properties and patterns of archaeological information. Fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding.\n\nAI science is capable of complementing and enhancing almost any area of scientific archaeological research. It incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in quantitative archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures. This opens archaeological analysis to a wide range of computer-based information processing methods fit to solve problems of great complexity. It also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines, both in methods and software technology. Its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other:\n\nFundamental research (theoretical AI science) on the structure, properties and possibilities of archaeological data, inference and knowledge building. This includes modeling and managing fuzziness and uncertainty in archaeological data, scale effects, optimal sampling strategies and spatio-temporal effects.\nDevelopment of computer algorithms and software (applied AI science) that make this theoretical knowledge available to the user.\n\nThere is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology. The development of methods and applications is best reflected in the annual publications of the CAA conference (see external links section at bottom). At least two journals, the Italian Archeologia e Calcolatori and the British Archaeological Computing Newsletter, are dedicated to archaeological computing methods. AI Science contributes to many fundamental research topics, including but not limited to:\n\nadvanced statistics in archaeology, spatial and temporal archaeological data analysis\n bayesian analysis and advanced probability models, fuzziness and uncertainty in archaeological data\n scale-related phenomena and scale transgressions\n intrasite analysis (representations of stratigraphy, 3D analysis, artefact distributions)\n landscape analysis (territorial modeling, visibility analysis)\n optimal survey and sampling strategies\n process-based modeling and simulation models\n archaeological predictive modeling and heritage management applications\n supervised and unsupervised classification and typology, artificial intelligence applications\n digital excavations and virtual reality\n computational reproducibility of archaeological research\n archaeological software development, electronic data sharing and publishing\n\nAI science advocates a formalized approach to archaeological inference and knowledge building. It is interdisciplinary in nature, borrowing, adapting and enhancing method and theory from numerous other disciplines such as computer science (e.g. algorithm and software design, database design and theory), geoinformation science (spatial statistics and modeling, geographic information systems), artificial intelligence research (supervised classification, fuzzy logic), ecology (point pattern analysis), applied mathematics (graph theory, probability theory) and statistics.\n\nTraining and research \nScientific progress in archaeology, as in any other discipline, requires building abstract, generalized and transferable knowledge about the processes that underlie past human actions and their manifestations. Quantification provides the ultimate known way of abstracting and extending our scientific abilities past the limits of intuitive cognition. Quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research. They provide the tools, algebra, statistics and computer algorithms, to process information too voluminous or complex for purely cognitive, informal inference. They also build a bridge between archaeology and numerous quantitative sciences such as geophysics, geoinformation sciences and applied statistics. And they allow archaeological scientists to design and carry out research in a formal, transparent and comprehensible way.\n\nBeing an emerging field of research, AI science is currently a rather dispersed discipline in need of stronger, well-funded and institutionalized embedding, especially in academic teaching. Despite its evident progress and usefulness, today's quantitative archaeology is often inadequately represented in archaeological training and education. Part of this problem may be misconceptions about the seeming conflict between mathematics and humanistic archaeology.\n\nNevertheless, digital excavation technology, modern heritage management and complex research issues require skilled students and researchers to develop new, efficient and reliable means of processing an ever-growing mass of untackled archaeological data and research problems. Thus, providing students of archaeology with a solid background in quantitative sciences such as mathematics, statistics and computer sciences seems today more important than ever.\n\nCurrently, universities based in the UK provide the largest share of study programmes for prospective quantitative archaeologists, with more institutes in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands developing a strong profile quickly. In Germany, the country's first lecturer's position in AI science (\"Archäoinformatik\") was established in 2005 at the University of Kiel (Benjamin Ducke, now at Oxford Archaeology), while currently there is only one regular junior professorship in Archaeoinformatics in the field of Classical Archaeology  at Freie Universität Berlin. From April 2016 a new full professorship in Archaeoinformatics will be established at the University of Cologne (Institute of Archaeology).",

      "content": "## Background\nIn January 2023, news reverberated across media outlets dedicated to breakthroughs innovations in biotechnology and in the healthcare sector. It announced the initiation of clinical trials for a protein kinase inhibitor INS018_055 - the first anti-fibrotic small molecule inhibitor with promising anti-tumor relevance, designed through the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). INS018_055 was developed by Insilico Medicine, a generative AI-driven clinical-stage biotechnology company. The discovery of INS018_055 was achieved by a team of researchers from Canada, China, and the United States within the span of less than a month, with results published in *Chemical Sciences* [1]. According to a press release from Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News (2023) the study “applied AlphaFold [an AI program which performs predictions of protein structure developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet] to an end-to-end AI-powered drug discovery platform (Pharma.AI) that includes a biocomputational engine (PandaOmics) and a generative chemistry platform (Chemistry42), to identify a new drug for a novel target for the treatment of the most common form of primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma.” [2].\nThe news of INS018_055’s success circulated globally, highlighting it as a promising result of integrating AI in biomedical research and drug discovery. The AI-generated protein illustrates the potential of the so-called autonomous experimentation (AE) systems to enhance and accelerate the discovery of advanced biochemical entities and responsive bionanomaterials of interest in clinical studies and biopharmaceutical industry.\nAlso known as autonomous laboratories, self-driven laboratories, or materials acceleration platforms, AE systems are digital platforms capable of running a large number of chemical experiments autonomously. AE are assisted by machine learning (ML) and other robust computational tools with a high level of precision, accuracy and resilience. Those systems can perform in days what scientists would take years to achieve, as proven by the example of INS018_055. Instead of manually replicating experiments and trial-and-error activities, AE systems build robust datasets and run experiments without the physical and intellectual limitations of humans. It reduces the risk for subjective interpretations of findings, due to data robustness and ML-driven hypothesis tests [3-5].\nDue to its efficiency in accelerating discovery and rationalizing the use of scarce material resources for R&D activity, AE is expected to have a significant impact on biomedical research. Specifically, areas such as chemical engineering and materials sciences, bioengineering and drug discovery, and molecular systems engineering, are propelling a dynamic pipeline of technologies and solutions of interest for the healthcare sector [6-8].\nThe promise of success for these systems, however, is in the context of increasing optimism about AI. As an expanding landscape of autonomous labs is being negotiated between scientists, industry, policymakers, and society, there is much to consider regarding the social and political dimensions of these technologies. I question how the examination of AE can shed light on a new wave of transformation in the global biomedical knowledge networks, and in which ways scientists, technology developers, science policymakers, and clinicians from emerging economies can overcome challenges to explore opportunities created by AE, and participate in global knowledge networks in this area.\nI am not aware of a study addressing implications of AE systems in biomedical research and health innovation with a specific focus on emerging economies. In recent decades, R&D activities in China and India, for example, have produced impact in the global configuration of biomedical knowledge infrastructures, becoming key players in the biotechnology industry, life sciences and biomedicine [9, 10].\nBy examining the increasing relevance of AE systems in contemporary R&D activities, this Debate article aims to explore the advancement of artificial intelligence in biomedical research and health innovation, highlighting its implications, challenges and opportunities for stakeholders in emerging economies. I reflect on the place occupied by emerging economies in the “AI in health” global innovation landscape, and what should be overcome to enable stakeholders to navigate the opportunities of AE in the current decade.\nThis Debate article is structured as it follows. Section 1 “Reconfigurations of biomedical knowledge infrastructures” briefly provides context to emerging economies as potential players in R&D in biomedical research and health innovation. Section 2 “Artificial intelligence and autonomous experimentation systems” discuss the emergence of this very recent field, highlighting its importance to scientific discovery of new chemicals and materials with clinical and therapeutical relevance. Section 3 “Autonomous experimentation in biomedical research and development” brings practical applications of AE in R&D activity, highlighting its relevance in Nanomedicine, AI-assisted drug discovery and precision oncology. Section 4 “Autonomous experimentation in emerging economies” explore challenges and opportunities for stakeholders from emerging economies to join AE efforts, to prepare institutions and society to benefit from AI in health-related innovation and research domains. Finally, “Conclusions” claims the increasing relevance of emerging economies in AE due to its growing capabilities in the area. Additionally, improving cultural and geographical representativeness of AE contributes to foster the diffusion and acceptance of AI in health-related R&D worldwide.\n",

The Environmental Protection Agency is the most severely affected, with nearly 90% of its staff being furloughed. This means regulatory work, research, and public updates have been paused indefinitely. Another affected agency is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). NFIP, which insures 4.7 million properties, cannot issue new policies or renewals, threatening real estate transactions and leaving homeowners vulnerable. Due to public safety needs, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will continue forecasting, but all nonessential research has been suspended. While no agencies have expressed plans for layoffs, President Trump has threatened mass firings.\n\nThis politicization of essential environmental services and threats of layoffs is damaging to regulatory stability, public trust, and long-term climate resilience in the United States and beyond. Stalling critical climate research and regulation could have serious repercussions in a time of increased climate risk.\n\n***\n\nFurther reading: US Government Shutdown Curtails Key Weather and Climate Programs\n\n## Omnibus agreement fails in European Parliament ahead of mid-October vote\n\nThe intended last round of discussions for the sustainability Omnibus took place on Tuesday. After tense negotiations, members of the European Parliament failed to reach an agreement. The primary issues under discussion include liability under the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), corporate regulations, and climate transition plans. Jörgen Warborn, Swedish member of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and lead negotiator, presented two packages. The first would raise the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and eliminate obligatory climate transition plans. This package has received the backing of the far-right. In the second package, the scope of CSRD would remain for companies with 1,000 employees, but compulsory implementation of CSDDD transition plans would be discarded. Warborn said that his goal “has always been to simplify and cut cost for businesses.” The vote is set to take place on Tuesday, 13 October, provided that Parliament’s position is filed by 8 October.\n\n*** Further reading: Lawmakers fail to reach agreement on sustainability Omnibus as key vote looms\n\n## Renewable energy surplus attracts cryptocurrency miners to Brazil\n\nWith the country’s surplus in renewable power, cryptocurrency mining companies are looking to Brazil to begin mining projects. For a crypto transaction to be processed, complex mathematical problems must be solved on mining machines that have been known to overload grids worldwide. With minimal crypto mining and a surplus of energy, Brazil is an ideal location for crypto miners to focus their efforts. Cryptocurrency companies like Tether and Enegix are negotiating deals with Renova Energia and other Brazilian energy companies. Renova informed Reuters that it is launching a $200 million, 100 megawatt (MW) wind-powered mining operation in the northeast of Brazil. Despite these opportunities, challenges remain, including water scarcity, regulatory gaps, and inadequate infrastructure. Companies that wish to make smart and sustainable investment decisions should consider ESG solutions for guidance.\n\nFurther reading: Clean energy glut draws cryptocurrency miners to Brazil\n\n## European Union to raise tariffs and cut quotas on steel\n\nAccording to industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, the EU plans to decrease foreign steel import quotas by nearly 50% and significantly raise tariffs. These measures aim to protect the struggling steel industry by countering subsidized steel from Asia and North Africa. The U.S. and Canada have also begun similar measures, charging 50% tariffs on imported steel. The steel industry has requested 50% tariffs on any imports above the proposed quotas. The European Parliament and EU Member States must approve the plan. Séjourné urged industry workers and unions to back the proposal as he expects opposition from minority interests. Corporations can use ESG solutions to navigate the ever-changing landscape of regulations.\n\nFurther reading: EU to slash steel import quotas by almost half\n\nEditor’s Note: The opinions expressed here by the authors are their own, not those of impakter.com — In the Cover Photo: United States Capitol Building Cover Photo Credit: Caleb Perez\n\n### How Brazil’s Oil Giant Is Using Gen-Z Science and Climate Influencers to Green Up Its Image\n\n### Investing in People: The Path to Universal Access to Safe Water\n\n### Sarah Perras\n\nSarah Perras is a writer and environmental enthusiast.

      "content": "In 1991, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) embarked upon the extensive and comprehensive Earth Science Enterprise, a program to help us better understand what is happening on the Earth’s surface. The centerpiece of the Earth Science Enterprise is known as The Earth Observing System (EOS). The EOS website, located at **[http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/]()**, is designed to keep scientists, educators, and the news media informed about the system and its activities.\n\nEOS is composed of a series of satellites conducting long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. The first EOS satellite, Terra, was launched into orbit in December 1999. NASA hopes the data gathered by the system, the first to provide integrated measurements of processes occurring on Earth, can be used to help better predict climate change, oversee conservation efforts, and improve forecasting to help farmers, fishers, and other weather-dependent tradespeople.\n\nThe For Scientists section of the website provides links to overviews of the field experiments that EOS conducts, and contains information on what sorts of measurements EOS takes and what types of instruments are used. Also within this section are links to brochures, reference books, data product catalogs, a bibliography of EOS-related publications, and a calendar of workshops and conference seminars conducted by EOS personnel.\n\nTeachers looking for EOS-related resources can visit the For Educators section. The EOS Education Project, with a link located under the Educational Links subhead, has been developed for teachers and students at all levels to teach about topics including geographic information systems and remote sensing. The project offers outreach programs for teachers and Internet-based classes. This section also features a directory of other EOS-related teaching materials, including brochures, fact sheets, posters, lithographs, and lesson plans that can be downloaded or ordered for free. Also available are online tools for calculating when a satellite will pass overhead and tracking various satellites’ current location in the sky. Links to other websites include the main NASA Earth Science Enterprise educational website and the homepages of related agencies such as the National Science Foundation.\n\nNews writers have their own section on the website. Available under For News Media is the Earth Observatory Newsroom, which contains press releases on the latest EOS research, NASA news announcements, and a list of newly published research. This section also features the EOS Global Change Media Directory 2001. This resource lists 343 scientists working in fields such as ozone chemistry, global warming, and ecosystems who have expressed interest in working with the media. Science writers’ guides to individual spacecraft provide extensive background material and contact information.\n\nThe site’s Data Services section provides links to the different types of data that the EOS and its partners provide. This section links to NASA’s Global Change Master Directory website, which provides extensive data sets on 13 topics, including agriculture, human dimensions, oceans, and sun-Earth interactions. Subscribers can add to the data sets and participate in an online discussion list.\n",

Not getting enough rest can have impacts beyond simply feeling sluggish the next day, though.\n\nSome research indicates that chronic sleep issues can impact one’s mood and raise the risk of health issues, such as having a heart attack. The latter likely occurs because poor sleep disrupts the body’s immune system, which can increase inflammation.\n\nThe researchers in the new study took a closer look at sleep and brain age by studying more than 27,000 adults in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe adults had an average age of around 55 when the study began, and about 54% of the participants were females, and around 46% of the participants were males.\n\nThe participants completed a series of questionnaires at the start of the study that covered sleep aspects, such as hours of sleep, daytime sleepiness, and snoring.\n\nThe researchers used these responses to determine the sleep scores of the participants and then divided them into three categories:\n\n- healthy sleep patterns (41%)\n\n- intermediate sleep patterns (56%)\n\n- poor sleep patterns (3%).\n\nThe researchers also took blood samples at the baseline to check for inflammation markers in the body.\n\n## Poor sleep ages the brain faster\n\nAround 9 years after collecting the participants’ baseline data, they underwent MRI scans to evaluate their brain age. Next, the researchers compared the participants’ brain age to their chronological age.\n\nThe researchers found that people with worse sleep scores had a “brain age gap” of 1 year on average.\n\nPeople with the lowest scores had the biggest gap between their brain age and actual age, with brain aging accelerating by about 6 months for every drop in sleep quality score.\n\nThe connection between sleep and brain age was stronger in men than in women, which study author Abigail Dove, PhD, a a postdoctoral researcher in neuroepidemiology at the Aging Research Center at Karolinska, told Medical News Today was a “surprising” find.\n\nDove told MNT there are a few reasons for this finding, including lifestyle habits:\n\n“It could be that the self-reported measure of sleep used in our study didn’t capture sleep disturbances equally well in men and women. We could also be missing some differences in lifestyle behaviors or drug/medication use between men and women that influences sleep.”\n\nThe researchers also found that inflammation explained about 10% of the connection between poor sleep and accelerated brain aging.\n\n“This underscores that inflammation is a major mechanism connecting sleep to brain aging, although it is not the only factor at play,” commented Dove.\n\nOverall, the study shows that sleep may play a key role in maintaining brain health.\n\n## Why brain age acceleration matters\n\nRaj Dasgupta, MD, chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis, who was not involved in this research, spoke with MNT about the study findings.\n\n“This study really underscores something we’ve suspected for a while: poor sleep isn’t just about feeling tired the next day, it can actually affect your brain’s aging,” said Dasgupta. “People with insomnia, snoring, or restless nights may have brains that look older than they really are, which highlights how important good sleep is for long-term cognitive health.”\n\nWhile a 1-year difference in brain aging may not sound significant at first, Dasgupta noted that “even small changes in brain aging can add up over time.”\n\nFor people concerned about their sleep quality and brain aging, Dasgupta shared a few suggestions for improving sleep.\n\n“Stick to a regular sleep schedule, make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet, limit caffeine or big meals before bed, and try relaxing routines like reading or meditation,” shared Dasgupta. “And if sleep problems persist, talking with a sleep specialist can help identify underlying issues and get you back on track.”\n\nDaniel Truong, MD, neurologist and medical director of the Truong Neuroscience Institute at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center, likewise not involved in the recent study, also spoke with MNT about its finidngs.\n\n“The study you shared makes a strong case that poor sleep accelerates brain aging, with systemic inflammation playing a measurable mediating role,” said Truong.\n\nTruong also commented on the significance of a 1-year difference in brain aging.\n\n“When combined with other risks (hypertension, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle), even modest brain age acceleration can tip someone closer to dementia or cognitive decline,” pointed out Truong.\n\n“Don’t panic, but don’t ignore it,” he advised. “If you snore heavily, feel excessively sleepy in the daytime, or have long-term insomnia, it’s worth evaluation–not only for brain health but also for cardiovascular and metabolic health.”\n\n- Neurology / Neuroscience\n\n- Seniors / Aging\n\n- Sleep / Sleep Disorders / Insomnia\n\n- antiaging\n\n## Latest news\n\n- To keep the brain young, safeguard your sleep, study suggests\n\n- Daily combo of water, coffee, and tea linked to longevity\n\n- What to eat and drink before and after a flu shot: Expert Q&amp;A\n\n- Gene therapy slows Huntington's disease for first time, clinical trial shows\n\n- How might fat distribution in the body influence cancer risk?\n\n### Related Coverage\n\nThis podcast episode examines two studies that assess the impact type 2 diabetes has on brain health and explores three lifestyle interventions that…\n\nIn this episode of In Conversation, Dr. Tom Barber, professor of endocrinology and obesity expert, helps us explore the evidence linking a…\n\nSleep is important for energy, avoiding weight gain, lowering the risk of heart disease, and reducing stress.
