The advanced model is just one example of the new technologies driving the center’s expanded research. Photo courtesy Cheryl Gerber.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n\n- Tulane renames National Primate Research Center to Tulane National Biomedical Research Center.\n\n- Center receives $35M annually from NIH and partners with 500 investigators worldwide.\n\n- Research spans infectious diseases, chronic illness, aging, and neurodegeneration.\n\n- New methodologies include AI, organ-on-a-chip systems, and reduced animal use.\n\nTulane University‘s long-standing National Primate Research Center has officially adopted a new name to reflect its expanding research scope and growing contributions to public health. The facility will now be known as the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center.\n\nThe announcement was made as the center continues to serve as a major hub for biomedical research at its Covington campus, addressing pressing health challenges and advancing scientific understanding.\n\nTulane President Michael A. Fitts emphasized that the new name represents an “exciting chapter” as the center broadens its research efforts beyond primate studies.\n\nSince 1964, the center has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, making it Tulane’s largest and longest-running NIH grant recipient. The facility receives approximately $35 million annually in NIH support, partners with nearly 500 investigators from 155 institutions worldwide, and contributes over $107 million a year to Louisiana’s economy. With more than 350 employees, it is also one of St. Tammany Parish’s largest employers.\n\nThe Tulane National Biomedical Research Center is home to one of the nation’s seven National Primate Research Centers and one of 12 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories, along with a federally regulated Select Agent Program. These facilities underpin its role as a critical component of the U.S. biomedical research infrastructure and a key partner in preparing for emerging health threats.\n\nResearch conducted at the center has advanced understanding of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease, while also exploring links between infection, chronic illness, aging, and neurodegeneration. During public health crises, its scientists have provided rapid insights that have informed global responses, including the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments.\n\nIn recent years, the center has expanded its methodologies to include advanced non-animal research tools, such as computer modeling, machine learning, AI-guided analysis, and organ-on-a-chip systems. These approaches complement primate studies, allowing scientists to reduce animal use while generating precise, translatable results.\n\n“Nonhuman primates provide the essential bridge between discovery in the lab and safe, effective therapies for people,” said Jay Rappaport, director and chief academic officer of the center. “At the same time, our science has grown beyond primate research alone. Our new name reflects the full spectrum of work we do, our commitment to using animals responsibly, and the highest standards of scientific integrity that continue to guide everything we do.”\n\nThe rebranding also positions the center to strengthen collaborations with academic, government, and industry partners, solidifying its status as a national leader in biomedical research and innovation.\n\n- Tulane launches Founder Lab to boost innovation\n\n- Lead-resistant lizards in New Orleans could hold clues to combating lead poisoning\n\n- Whooping cough cases on the rise in Louisiana\n\nShare this!\n\n## Related Content\n\n### Loyola University launches $3M campaign to upgrade sports complex\n\nLoyola University New Orleans begins a $3 million campaign to renovate its University Sports Complex with a $1[...]\n\nOctober 10, 2025\n\n### Louisiana community college system leader to retire\n\nLCTCS President Monty Sullivan will retire next year after a decade of leadership that expanded graduates and [...]\n\n### Delgado Maritime Center unveils major upgrades, new training programs\n\nDelgado Community College renovates its Maritime Center, adding advanced simulators, training pads, and progra[...]\n\nOctober 3, 2025\n\n### Louisiana achieves top reading gains while spending far less per student\n\nLouisiana ranks second nationally in adjusted fourth grade reading scores, despite spending less per student t[...]\n\nOctober 2, 2025\n\n### LSU could hire its next president by the end of October\n\nLSU’s presidential search is moving faster, with finalists expected by Oct. 21 and a board vote possible at [...]\n\n### Industrial giants stand to gain $3.5B in tax credits for carbon capture\n\nLouisiana’s carbon capture projects could bring $3.5B in federal tax credits through the 45Q program, reshap[...]\n\n## New Orleans CityBusiness Daily\n\nGet our free New Orleans e-alerts & breaking news notifications!\n\n- By signing up you agree to our\n\n## News\n\n## Bollinger-led team to build six U.S. Coast Guard Arctic cutters\n\nBollinger Shipyards will lead a global team to build six U.S. Coast Guard Arctic cutters, expanding America’s polar fleet a[...]\n\n## NOLA Detox expands to Slidell with new campus, adds 30 jobs\n\nNOLA Detox expands with a 30-bed Slidell campus, adding 30 jobs and increasing treatment capacity to 78 beds in south Louisia[...]\n\n## EquipmentShare opens new branch in St. Tammany Parish, creates 120 jobs\n\nEquipmentShare opens ninth Louisiana branch in St. Tammany Parish, creating 120 jobs and expanding construction tech services[...]\n\n## Savannah Bananas to play Banana Ball at Caesars Superdome in 2026\n\nThe Savannah Bananas bring fast-paced Banana Ball to New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome March 14-15, 2026.\n\n## Louisiana cancels another major coastal restoration project\n\nLouisiana halts the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion, citing rising costs and potential environmental impacts on coastal restora[...]\n\n## Construction & Real Estate\n\n## NOLA Detox expands to Slidell with new campus, adds 30 jobs\n\nNOLA Detox expands with a 30-bed Slidell campus, adding 30 jobs and increasing treatment c[...]\n\n## Energy\n\nEPA details progress on response to Smitty’s fire\n\n9/10/2025\n\nUS oil production reached record-high 13.6 million barrels a day in Ju[...]\n\n8/10/2025\n\nEnergy initiative details workforce innovation program efforts\n\nIce batteries cool hospitals, lower energy costs\n\n7/10/2025\n\nLDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks.

      "content": "In August, an 80-year-old woman walked into the emergency room at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. She was lucid but experiencing a stroke. Within minutes, doctors asked for permission to pull out the stroke-causing clot before any more brain damage could occur.\n\nShe hesitated. The procedure was part of a clinical trial, and she’d heard about a federal freeze on research grants to UCLA. She wanted to know: Would this study be at risk, potentially affecting her care?\n\nThose worries put unnecessary pressure on a patient facing the loss of roughly 2 million nerve cells every minute that treatment was delayed, said Jeffrey Saver, a neurologist and longtime stroke researcher.\n\n“To then have to worry about what’s happening with the funding from the federal government is a needless increase in the stress patients are going through,” Saver said.\n\nPatients and researchers such as Saver have found themselves caught in the middle as the Trump administration has accused major universities of antisemitism and bias, pulling research funds in an attempt to extract concessions.\n\nScientists who have spent their lives developing treatments for lung cancer, brain tumors, and Alzheimer’s disease say scientific funding should not be politicized — and warn that patients waiting for lifesaving treatments stand to lose the most. They also worry that funding cuts mired in legal challenges could discourage would-be scientists from entering the field, reducing the chances for medical breakthroughs.\n\n“I would have thought that stroke and Alzheimer’s disease and all these conditions affect Democrats and Republicans alike and would be supported by everyone,” Saver said. “The reasons for the suspension don’t seem to tie into the work we’re doing.”\n\n#### Email Sign-Up\n\nIn July, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Energy Department froze $584 million in medical and science research grants to UCLA after the Justice Department said the university had violated the civil rights of Jewish students during pro-Palestinian protests. The Trump administration proposed a settlement that would require UCLA to pay a $1.2 billion fine and overhaul campus policies on admissions, hiring, and gender-affirming health care to reinstate the grants.\n\nYet the federal government plays a crucial role in funding lifesaving research that industry has little incentive to back. Saver said treatment discoveries made in the past 15 years have been “transformative” for stroke care. To keep eight clinical trials afloat, Saver said, he and other neurology department faculty members sought outside funding and agreed to salary cuts. But they were close to running out before federal funds were restored.\n\nIn the ER, doctors told the stroke patient not to worry. Given the need to study her particular symptoms, they tapped a pot of private donations to cover the procedure. She enrolled and was treated.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has been challenging President Donald Trump more directly as he builds a national profile, has likened the president’s demands to extortion.\n\nAnd Newsom last week threatened to “instantly” take away state funding from any California university that signs a compact Trump put forth that prioritizes federal research funds to institutions that adhere to the administration’s definitions of gender, limit international students, and change admissions policies, among other stipulations. “California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nIn September, U.S. District Judge Rita Lin of the Northern District of California ordered frozen NIH grants in the state to flow again, folding UCLA researchers into a lawsuit initially brought by researchers from the University of California-Berkeley and UC-San Francisco in June after federal agencies slashed hundreds of millions in grants to UC campuses.\n\nSome private academic institutions have reclaimed their funding by agreeing to pay hefty fines and changing campus policies, including Columbia University, which agreed to pay $200 million, and Brown University, which settled for $50 million. Meanwhile, last month a federal judge ruled that the administration’s cancellation of some $2.6 billion in grants to Harvard was illegal.\n\nStill, researchers worry the relief is temporary. Even with the district court’s restoration, the case brought by UC researchers is still pending and could ultimately be decided in Trump’s favor. The White House has vowed to appeal the ruling to restore Harvard’s funding, while heightening scrutiny of the school’s finances.\n\n“We haven’t seen everything play out yet. Lots of scientists and researchers and people who run labs are circumspect, knowing that the near future could be a bit bumpy,” said Jessica Levinson, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School. “They should feel like this is a win, but it’s possible that it’s a short-lived one.”\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about potential harm done to studies while the funds were frozen, or criticisms that they are wrongly politicizing money for potentially lifesaving research.\n\nIn a statement about the administration’s campaign targeting antisemitism, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said that “we will not fund institutions that promote antisemitism. We will use every tool we have to ensure institutions follow the law.”\n\nHHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a follow-up statement that the department is “steadfast in its commitment to advancing groundbreaking biomedical research” and that it continues to “invest strategically in research that tackles today’s urgent challenges.”\n\nMost of the UCLA funding freezes affected foundational science that doesn’t directly involve patients but has the potential to vastly improve treatment. David Shackelford, a researcher exploring novel ways to stunt the growth of therapy-resistant lung cancer, said he was nearing a potential breakthrough for treating the disease, which kills 9 in 10 patients within five years of a diagnosis.\n\n“I’m not used to my science being politicized,” Shackelford said. “It’s cancer. We should never even be having this discussion.”\n\nAs court battles play out, Democratic state legislators are considering placing a $23 billion bond on next year’s ballot dedicating state funds to continue advances in cancer, stroke, and infectious disease research, among other scientific research. But state bond money, if approved by voters, wouldn’t come close to replacing federal grants, which traditionally finance the lion’s share of biomedical research.\n\nIn 2024 alone, for example, roughly $5.1 billion in NIH funding flowed to California, with $3.8 billion of that going to universities. And the proposed bond would be broad, one-time funding that could pay for other study areas, such as climate change research, marine ecosystems, or wildfire prevention.\n\nUC President James Milliken said the possibility of even bigger federal cuts to the state’s second-largest employer would have ripple effects across California’s economy.\n\nWhile other universities have sued the Trump administration, UC leaders have instead engaged in “good faith dialogue” with the Justice Department in hopes of negotiating a settlement, Milliken said.\n\nS. Thomas Carmichael, a neurologist at UCLA, said about 55 grants totaling $23 million from the NIH, including studies of migraines, epilepsy, and autism, were frozen in his department at the David Geffen School of Medicine. As bad as funding cuts are, he warned of the Trump administration’s ability to attack a school’s accreditation, to limit visas for international students, or to launch investigations.\n\n“It’s essentially a complete and total power mismatch to take the federal government on,” Carmichael said. “If you simply give no ground, yield nothing, you won’t win.”\n\nSeparately, in mid-September, a group of UC labor unions and faculty associations filed suit against the federal government, claiming the threat to research funds amounted to “financial coercion” to adopt campus policies that would restrict free speech. A hearing in that case is scheduled for December.\n\nBrenda L., a UCLA patient, said she was devastated when a scan in 2021 led to her stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis at age 70. After 18 months on Tagrisso, a drug considered the gold standard for treating this particular cancer, her tumors started growing again. (Brenda declined to provide her full name because she hasn’t disclosed her diagnosis to some family members.)\n\n“I was just feeling like, well, that’s the end of me,” said Brenda, who’s now 75 and lives in Bakersfield. She joined a clinical trial and has been taking another experimental drug alongside Tagrisso for two years. The combination has all but stopped the cancer’s progression.\n\n“I’m the lucky one,” said Brenda, whose current trial has not been impacted. “Other patients, they should have that same chance.”\n\nThis article was produced by KFF Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\n- Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X\n\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook\n\n- Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn\n\n- Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email\n\n- Click to print (Opens in new window) Print\n\n- Republish This Story\n\n- California\n\n- Public Health\n\n- States\n\n- Trump Administration\n\n### More From KFF Health News\n\nSenators Press Deloitte, Other Contractors on Errors in Medicaid Eligibility Systems\n\nTrump Called Digital Equity Act ‘Racist.’ Now Internet Money for Rural Americans Is Gone.\n\nCops on Ketamine?

      "content": "Skip to main\n\n## You are here\n\n# The latest from the evolving AI channel: 9 October\n\nThere is always an abundance of AI technology announcements, here are some interesting ones that can aid the channel.\n\nNFON, a provider of integrated business communications, is advancing its European AI offensive as part of its NFON Next 2027 strategy.\n\nThe latest innovation is Nia FrontDesk, an AI-powered virtual inbound call agent that intelligently recognises, answers and forwards incoming calls. The solution reduces waiting times, ensures faster call handling and relieves employees of repetitive tasks. Its features include:\n\n-Intelligent call forwarding: Nia understands caller requests (\"I would like to speak to the accounts department\") and forwards calls accordingly, depending on availability.\n\n-FAQ: Nia also automatically answers frequently asked questions such as opening hours, document dispatch or standard information – at any time and without waiting times.\n\n-Fallback options: If the person you are calling is unavailable, alternative contacts are offered.\n\n-Seamless integration: Fully embedded in NFON business telephony, without external systems or complex configuration.\n\n-Data security: GDPR-compliant, data processing exclusively in Europe.\n\nNia FrontDesk is aimed at companies with high call volumes, from healthcare, insurance and finance to retail and other industries.\n\n-Hitachi Vantara is working towards a strategic partnership with Supermicro, combining Supermicro’s GPU and AI compute capabilities with the performance and scale of Hitachi Vantara’s Virtual Storage Platform One (VSP One), giving enterprises a foundation for driving AI infrastructure, mission-critical applications and data-intensive workloads.\n\nThe parties are finalising terms of an agreement that would enable Supermicro to sell VSP One to its customers, and Hitachi Vantara will be able to sell Supermicro servers, storage, GPUs and hardware systems, broadening availability through established channels.\n\n-Infor is launching an expansion of its suite of AI-driven solutions for micro-verticals, optimising how technology can address the unique challenges and demands across industries, from dairy producers, and EV manufacturers, to textile fabricators, and more.\n\nBuilt natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Amazon Bedrock to provide flexible access to high-performing large language models, the new Infor Industry AI Agents, along with Infor Leap - a “fast and cost-effective cloud migration offer” - allow companies to “quickly realise the benefits of the technologies they’re heavily investing in”.\n\nInfor Industry AI Agents are experts in a broad spectrum of industries and require minimal training before helping organisations achieve continuous process optimisation in core operational areas such as projects, products, supply chain, and workforce operations, we are told.\n\nInfor Industry AI Agents are built on Infor’s Industry Process Catalogues and Value Maps across eight key industries and their micro-verticals. This gives the agents contextual understanding of industry processes, terminology, compliance factors, and KPIs for “more immediate, impactful customer outcomes”.\n\n-Checkmarx, a specialist in agentic-AI powered application security testing, has announced “record-breaking growth” for its flagship platform, Checkmarx One.\n\nCheckmarx One now protects more than 860 of the world’s largest enterprises. “This wave of customer adoption has propelled the platform beyond $150m in ARR in three years, cementing Checkmarx One as one of the fastest-growing platforms in application security,” maintains the firm.\n\nEach month, Checkmarx analyses over 800 billion lines of code, performs four million scans, secures more than three million open-source packages, and inspects nearly a million container images, all while identifying approximately half a million malicious packages before they can impact organisations.\n\n-Pendo, the software experience management platform, has introduced Agent Mode, a conversational and agentic way to use Pendo. Agent Mode is designed as a copilot for product teams that automates the “tedious, time-consuming tasks and workflows that slow them down”.\n\nInstead of spending hours analysing feedback, building reports, or manually finding users for research, product managers can simply ask Agent Mode to do it for them. The result is more time spent understanding and solving user challenges, and less time buried in operational work.\n\nBy streamlining how teams interact with Pendo, Agent Mode increases productivity, which helps companies get innovation to market faster, the supplier said.\n\nPendo also says users can now connect Pendo data to LLMs like Claude or Agentforce through the open Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing instant access to usage, adoption, and sentiment inside existing enterprise tools.\n\n-Systal Technology Solutions, a global specialist in managed network, cloud and security transformation, has unveiled Secure AI Manager (SAM), an agentic AI-powered platform designed to transform how enterprises manage complex IT environments.\n\nLegacy tools, fragmented systems, and siloed vendors make it increasingly difficult to monitor and manage enterprise estates effectively.\n\nSAM addresses this challenge by giving enterprises a single, consolidated view of their entire multi-vendor IT environment, without the need for IT transformation. The SAM platform continuously monitors for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, automates compliance checks against key industry frameworks, and uses AI and machine learning to predict and resolve issues before they disrupt operations.\n\n-PagerDuty has unveiled an end-to-end AI agent suite. Customers that have tried the suite have been able to resolve incidents “up to 50% faster”, allowing engineering to reclaim thousands of innovation hours across all incidents.\n\nPagerDuty’s AI agent suite empowers teams to move beyond manual, reactive incident response. The PagerDuty SRE Agent learns from related incidents, automatically surfaces context, and recommends and executes diagnostics and remediations. Additionally, the SRE agent generates self-updating runbooks, which reduce cognitive load and prevent recurring issues.\n\nThe PagerDuty Scribe Agent instantly transcribes Zoom calls and chat conversations, generating structured summaries and status updates in Slack or Microsoft Teams, so teams “never miss a critical detail during or after an incident”, PagerDuty said.\n\nAnd the PagerDuty Shift Agent detects and resolves on-call scheduling conflicts automatically, freeing managers and responders to focus on high-impact work. Also, PagerDuty Insights Agent delivers context-aware answers and proactive recommendations based on PagerDuty analytics, helping teams anticipate and prevent issues before they escalate.\n\n-Oracle NetSuite has introduced NetSuite Next, designed to be collaborative, insightful, adaptive, and trustworthy, and equipped with embedded conversational intelligence, agentic workflows, and natural language search capabilities.\n\nCore to the NetSuite Next user experience is Ask Oracle, a natural language assistant that enables users to search, navigate, analyse, and act across the entire NetSuite dataset using their own words. It delivers context-aware answers, visualisations, interactive content, and reasoning that explains the “how” and “why” behind every response, and enables users to more easily collaborate with NetSuite.\n\n-AlphaSense, the AI platform for the business and financial world, has surpassed $500m in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The milestone is said to reflect accelerating market adoption of AlphaSense’s agentic workflows and AI capabilities, as well as growing demand for trusted, enterprise-wide AI insights that drive smarter decisions at scale.\n\nOver 6,500 customers trust AlphaSense to fuel their decision-making, including Google, JP Morgan, Pfizer, Microsoft, Nvidia, UBS, Unilever, and 88% of the S&P 100.\n\nSend your evolving AI channel news to: a_savvas@yahoo.co.uk\n\n## Related Content\n\n### Oracle NetSuite improves partner support around agentic AI\n\nOracle NetSuite has announced updates to its NetSuite SuiteCloud Developer Network partner...\n\n### NFON overhauls 3,000 partner channel to tap into AI services business\n\nWith its serious move into AI services, cloud communications provider NFON has announced a new,...\n\n### NFON puts some meat on the bones of its channel-friendly AI move\n\nAs previously reported this week, cloud communications provider NFON is making a big play in the AI...\n\n- Load more",

      "content": "The European Commission is introducing two strategies to position the European Union as a global leader in AI: Apply AI and AI in Science. The initiatives aim to accelerate AI adoption in key industrial sectors and promote scientific research, supported by a multi-billion-euro investment to compete with the United States and China. \"I want the future of AI to be made in Europe,\" says Ursula von der Leyen, President, European Commission. \"When we use AI, we find smarter, faster, and more affordable solutions. Its adoption must become widespread, and with these strategies, we will help to accelerate that process.\" In April 2025, the commission presented the AI Continent Action Plan, a roadmap that combines regulatory measures like the AI Act with promotional actions to solidify the region's global technological position. As AI transforms business operations, public services, and science, these new strategies focus on practical execution and investment. The objective is to ensure the bloc not only regulates the technology but also innovates and applies it at scale, mobilizing resources to maintain its competitive edge. The two strategies are designed to simultaneously address the commercial application and the fundamental scientific development of AI. This creates a comprehensive ecosystem that extends from the laboratory to the market. Apply AI: Fostering Industrial Adoption The Apply AI strategy is designed to speed up the integration of artificial intelligence into strategic public and private sectors, with an initial funding of €1 billion (US$1.16 billion). Its market-oriented approach seeks to reduce the time from concept to the commercial availability of AI-based solutions. The initial priority sectors include health, energy, mobility, manufacturing, construction, agri-food, defense, communications, and culture. Finance, tourism, and e-commerce are expected to be incorporated later. The plan includes specific measures for each sector, for example, creating advanced centers for early disease detection and developing frontier models tailored to the needs of industries like pharmaceuticals. The operation of Apply AI will be structured through several key mechanisms. An \"AI First\" policy will encourage companies, with a particular emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to view AI as a primary tool for operational growth and efficiency. Concurrently, the European Digital Innovation Hubs will be transformed into AI Experience Centers to offer companies preferential access to innovations, services, and the bloc's technology ecosystem. To coordinate these efforts, the Apply AI Alliance, a new forum, will bring together representatives from industry, the public sector, academia, and civil society. Finally, an AI Observatory will be established to monitor trends, identify risks, and assess the technology's sector-specific impact, providing data for decision-making. Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, European Commission, says that the strategy will allow the European Union \"to strengthen our competitiveness and reinforce our technological sovereignty.\" AI in Science: Advancing Cutting-Edge Research In parallel, the AI in Science strategy aims to place the European Union at the forefront of AI-driven scientific research and innovation. Its central pillar is the creation of the Resource for AI Science in Europe (RAISE), a virtual institute that will centralize and coordinate resources for AI development and application in science. RAISE's actions are structured around four pillars. The first, Talent Development and Attraction, will allocate €58 million (US$67 million) to excellence and doctoral networks under the RAISE pilot project to train, retain, and attract highly qualified professionals. The second pillar, Computing Capabilities, involves a €600 million (US$693 million) investment from the Horizon Europe program to expand access for researchers and startups to the computational power of \"AI gigafactories.\" The third pillar addresses Research Funding, doubling Horizon Europe's annual investments in AI to over €3 billion (US$3.46 billion) to encourage its development and use in scientific projects. The fourth pillar, Strategic Data Access, will provide support to scientists to identify information gaps and to collect, curate, and integrate the datasets required to train AI models. RAISE \"will be the catalyst, bringing together resources, mobilizing investment and attracting the best talent from Europe and beyond,\" says Iliana Ivanova, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, European Commission. With these measures, the European Commission seeks to ensure the bloc has the resources, infrastructure, and human capital required to capitalize on the global AI trend.",

      "content": "# A trillion dollar climate risk\n\nOil rig in Scotland, 2020. Image: Rab Lawrence. Creative Commons 2.0.\n\nThe world’s largest banks carry more than $1.6 trillion in credit exposures to coal, oil and gas production and fossil-fuel power, according to research published today by Finance Watch.\n\nFinance Watch’s research offers a solution, at limited cost. A climate systemic risk buffer would provide banks with a dedicated cushion against fossil fuel losses and discourage the further buildup of climate risk, protecting the financial system and taxpayers from a crisis.\n\nAccording to Finance Watch’s calculations, it would be relatively easy to implement such a buffer at EU Banks, which would only need to retain a few weeks of profits to fund the additional capital. It could be introduced without affecting banks’ ability to lend to the real economy.\n\nMispricing\n\nJulia Symon, Head of Research and Advocacy at Finance Watch, said: “Banks have more than a trillion dollars of exposure to mispriced fossil fuel assets.\n\n\"This is a carbon bubble that could burst, like subprimes in 2008. This risk is not properly recognised and banks are not prepared. Banks' risk models either look backwards or rely on forward-looking climate scenarios that fail to capture the complexities of climate change.\n\n\"That allows risk to keep building up. A sudden policy shift or major climate event could trigger sharp market corrections, sending fossil asset prices tumbling.”\n\nShe added: “More worrying, their mispricing of fossil fuel loans keeps financing flowing into the industry, accelerating the climate crisis, and multiplying risks across the financial system.”\n\nTransition\n\nGreg Ford, the report’s author and Senior Advisor to Finance Watch, said: “There is a glaring prudential gap that is causing climate-related systemic risks at banks to go unchecked.\n\n\"Our research shows that a climate systemic risk buffer would be a low-cost, high-benefit solution to curb the build-up of these risks and make banks more resilient. Crucially, it could be introduced without affecting EU banks’ lending capacity.\n\n“Policymakers cannot ignore a trillion dollars of mispriced climate risk sitting on bank balance sheets. The longer action is delayed, the greater the chance of a disorderly correction that will hit citizens and the wider economy.”\n\nThe European Central Bank recently warned that “an insufficiently orderly transition to a green economy may translate into significant losses for the banking sector on exposures related to high-emission firms”. Yet official data shows that climate risks are still not being incorporated properly into banks’ internal models.\n\nThis Author\n\nBrendan Montague is a member of the editorial team at The Ecologist.

      "content": "In 1991, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) embarked upon the extensive and comprehensive Earth Science Enterprise, a program to help us better understand what is happening on the Earth’s surface. The centerpiece of the Earth Science Enterprise is known as The Earth Observing System (EOS). The EOS website, located at **[http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/]()**, is designed to keep scientists, educators, and the news media informed about the system and its activities.\n\nEOS is composed of a series of satellites conducting long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. The first EOS satellite, Terra, was launched into orbit in December 1999. NASA hopes the data gathered by the system, the first to provide integrated measurements of processes occurring on Earth, can be used to help better predict climate change, oversee conservation efforts, and improve forecasting to help farmers, fishers, and other weather-dependent tradespeople.\n\nThe For Scientists section of the website provides links to overviews of the field experiments that EOS conducts, and contains information on what sorts of measurements EOS takes and what types of instruments are used. Also within this section are links to brochures, reference books, data product catalogs, a bibliography of EOS-related publications, and a calendar of workshops and conference seminars conducted by EOS personnel.\n\nTeachers looking for EOS-related resources can visit the For Educators section. The EOS Education Project, with a link located under the Educational Links subhead, has been developed for teachers and students at all levels to teach about topics including geographic information systems and remote sensing. The project offers outreach programs for teachers and Internet-based classes. This section also features a directory of other EOS-related teaching materials, including brochures, fact sheets, posters, lithographs, and lesson plans that can be downloaded or ordered for free. Also available are online tools for calculating when a satellite will pass overhead and tracking various satellites’ current location in the sky. Links to other websites include the main NASA Earth Science Enterprise educational website and the homepages of related agencies such as the National Science Foundation.\n\nNews writers have their own section on the website. Available under For News Media is the Earth Observatory Newsroom, which contains press releases on the latest EOS research, NASA news announcements, and a list of newly published research. This section also features the EOS Global Change Media Directory 2001. This resource lists 343 scientists working in fields such as ozone chemistry, global warming, and ecosystems who have expressed interest in working with the media. Science writers’ guides to individual spacecraft provide extensive background material and contact information.\n\nThe site’s Data Services section provides links to the different types of data that the EOS and its partners provide. This section links to NASA’s Global Change Master Directory website, which provides extensive data sets on 13 topics, including agriculture, human dimensions, oceans, and sun-Earth interactions. Subscribers can add to the data sets and participate in an online discussion list.\n",

The publication writes that it \"covers clean energy, carbon energy, nuclear energy and environmental science—plus the territory in between where law, policy and public opinion are shaped.\"\n\nEstablished in 2007, the Brooklyn, New York-based website covers environmental issues. In 2013 three of its staff members won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting on the Kalamazoo River oil spill in Michigan.\n\nHistory\n\nThe website was co-founded in 2007 by publisher David Sassoon and executive editor Stacy Feldman. Originally called SolveClimate News, it adopted its current name \"to counter the perception that it was an environmental advocacy organization.\" As a non-profit journalism outlet, Inside Climate Newss model is similar to that of ProPublica and the Center for Investigative Reporting, which have similarly gained recognition. Like the other two organizations, Inside Climate News publishes its content for free on the Web, collaborates with for-profit news organizations that republish some of the nonprofit's work with credit, and aims \"to tackle topics that bigger, better-known news organizations are not equipped or inclined to do.\"\n\nA 2015 article by Jillian Melchior in National Review said there are questions about Inside Climate News's possible conflict of interest and bias.\n\nAs of February 2018, Inside Climate News had a staff of 18, including 7 full-time reporters.\n\nAwards \nThree Inside Climate News reporters—Elizabeth McGowan, Lisa Song, and David Hasemyer—won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for their series of \"rigorous reports\" on the Kalamazoo River oil spill in Michigan, in which an Enbridge oil pipeline spill led to the costliest onshore oil spill in American history.  The Pulitzer citation praised the reporters for exporting the aftermath of the 2010-2012 oil spill and \"flawed regulation of the nation's oil pipelines, focusing on potential ecological dangers posed by diluted bitumen (or 'dilbit'), a controversial form of oil.\"\n\nIn April 2016, Inside Climate News was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, for the 2015 Exxon: The Road Not Taken series.  Inside Climate News was awarded a 2015 Sigma Delta Chi Award for excellence in journalism by the Society of Professional Journalists for the informational graphics in the Exxon: The Road Not Taken series, which \"provide a visual timeline of Exxon's views and efforts on climate change since the 1970s, and evidence of its uncertainty campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s.\" The White House Correspondents Association awarded Inside Climate News a share in the 2016 Edgar A.

      "content": "## Introduction\nNeuroscience is an exciting research field, and many recent discoveries have informed paradigm-shifts and innovations. For instance, the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Professors John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser, neuroscientists who discovered place cells and grid cells that form a built-in, global positioning system inside the brain (O'keefe and Burgess, [26]; Moser et al., [24]). Indeed, neuroscience research has received substantial support across the globe. In the United States, the Human Connectome Project was launched in 2009 (Battery, [2]), followed by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative in 2013 (Insel et al., [11]). Concurrently, the Human Brain Project was initiated in Europe (Markram, [23]). In Japan, the Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS) program started in 2014, and the Brain Science and Brain-Like Intelligence Technology project will soon be officially launched by China, though significant preliminary research has already been done (Grillner et al., [9]). With these abundant investments in neuroscience in recent years, more explorative, fundamental or basic research could be conducted, which eventually led to today's paradigm shifts-or paradigm shifts yet to come. For instance, the emergence of brain connectivity studies (Friston, [6]) in recent years may enable us to compare and contrast the normal and diseased brains, and thus identify abnormal brain connectivity patterns as potential biomarkers for neurologic diseases. These advances in the neuroscience field not only drive significant progress in brain biology but also confer practical implications to medicine. We should evaluate and track the changes regarding the landscape of neuroscience research, to indicate evolution regarding research directions, health care priorities and prime translational research topics over a defined period. Such information enables stakeholders to clearly and quickly identify the most influential research works and incorporate the latest evidence into research-informed education.\nBibliometric studies could provide relevant evaluations and assessments of the social and scientific relevance of a specific discipline or research field of interest (López-Muñoz et al., [22], [21]). There have been numerous bibliometric studies on the performance of neuroscience research outputs in specific countries, including China (Xu et al., [40]), India (Shahabuddin, [28]) and Sweden (Glänzel et al., [8]). In addition, similar studies have been conducted in relevant research fields such as psychiatry and psychopharmacology (López-Muñoz et al., [22], [21]). However, to our knowledge, no published study has reported overall changes in the landscape of neuroscience literature across the globe over the last decade.\nTherefore, the aims of this study was to identify the most productive core journals in the field from 2006 to 2015, determine the research terms with the highest citation impact, and compare the publication shares of research areas and contributing countries across these 10 years.\n",

      "content": "This Research Topic highlights recent advancements in our understanding of basic processes in cellular neuroscience with a special focus on pathological mechanisms that could lead to the development of promising new therapeutic strategies in the future. Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in translational neuroscience research, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell function in the nervous system in health and disease, partially spurred by well-funded research consortia. Undoubtedly, translational research is one of the most pressing matters in neuroscience. However, so far, big promised breakthroughs like curing Alzheimer's or understanding superior cognitive processes are not only lacking but seem to be even more distant than ever. Likely due to these unrealistic promises of the past of what neuroscience would be able to achieve by now, other more incremental but nonetheless fundamental advances have yet to reach broader public awareness. Partially, these advances have been enabled by improvements in research techniques like somatic cell reprogramming or single-cell RNA-sequencing that have gradually become more accessible to the research community worldwide. By using these techniques and employing them on very different research questions, new experiments have been performed and amounts of data collected that were hard to imagine only a couple of years ago. This current state of the art will define the (technical) progress that needs to be made in the next decade.\n\nThis Research Topic comprises a balanced mix of original research and review articles that contribute to current views as well as challenges and future perspectives in different fields of the neurosciences, such as the study of peripheral nervous system inflammation through transcriptomic analysis and molecular mechanisms of blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Brain development and function have been approached in relation to the role of the environment and the contribution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis. The potential of transcranial stimulation to improve brain plasticity has been examined and a novel model for controlling synaptic transmission proposed. Finally, somatic cell reprogramming has been examined for treating spinal cord injury. This topic sheds light on the techniques and current knowledge in the field that might soon lead to new therapies to understand and treat brain dysfunctions.\n\nThe study by [Liu et al.]() investigates inflammatory transcriptional alterations of mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons. By using single-cell RNA sequencing in the peripheral system of mice this original research paper revealed the heterogeneity of trigeminal neurons and their diverse neuronal transcriptomic responses to orofacial inflammation. Orofacial pain is a debilitating pain condition and a serious public health problem (Banigo et al., [1]). The observed heterogeneity in trigeminal ganglion neurons is surprising given that classically besides of their area of innervation, these neurons were considered relatively homogenous. The results of the present study might provide new ideas for the development of therapeutic strategies for orofacial inflammatory pain.\n\nThe review by [Chen et al.]() shed light on the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and its role in blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Ferroptosis, which in recent years has attracted more and more attention due to its possible role in nervous system disorders, is a cell death mode caused by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation accumulation (Li et al., [4]). The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from dangerous chemicals in the bloodstream thereby maintaining a tightly regulated microenvironment for neuronal signaling. Recently it has been shown that lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation are related to barrier dysfunction. This review examines the relationship between ferroptosis and blood-brain barrier dysfunction which may reveal new targets for the treatment of brain diseases.\n\nThe importance of epigenetics, the regulation of gene expression by environmental factors independently of DNA sequences, has constantly increased in recent years. The article by [Vázquez-Ágredos et al.]() provides a systemic review of epigenetic regulation of the environmental impact on adolescent neurobehavioral development. Adolescent behavior is not only characterized by novelty-seeking but also by increased stress responsivity (Spear, [6]) and early life stress has been linked to a higher risk for alcohol and drug use disorders (Kirsch and Lippard, [3]). This review focuses on the miRNA expression patterns in the rodent brain with a special interest in the impact of stress and drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine, cannabis, and ketamine. The authors point to a dynamic epigenetic network sensitive to environmental events with distinctive changes across adolescence. A deeper understanding of environmental threats during this critical period in neurodevelopment is fundamental for the understanding of psychiatric and addictive disorders emerging at this stage.\n\nOther external factors such as diets or alcohol consumption can impact brain function *via* the gut-brain axis. The original research article by [Higarza et al.]() proposes an important extension namely the liver-gut-brain axis. They investigated the dynamic changes of gut microbiota in different rodent models along the liver disease spectrum and found that liver damage affected the diversity and bacterial community structure. Moreover, they investigated potential changes in brain metabolism and cognition. They found changes in brain oxidative metabolism in many brain areas including the prefrontal, retrosplenial, and perirhinal cortices, as well as the amygdala and mammillary bodies, potentially accounting for the observed impact on working memory. In the future, gut microbiota could be more specifically targeted to design more effective treatments, for specific stages of liver disease.\n",
